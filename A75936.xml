            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was never learned, in the Schools of men, any other Language but the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> nor do I well underſtand many words that is ſpoken in that Language, that come from other Tongues: and therefore it cannot be expected that I ſhould place my words in what I write, in ſuch an outward Scholar like-way, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might have done, had I been brought up in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Schools of Learning. To ſhew outward Wiſdom, is not the thing I aim at in what I write, (nor ought it to be my aim, if I had it) becauſe the things of God, that is in the way that God makes uſe of to reſtore fallen man again unto himſelf, <hi>he will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 19. And therefore if I had been learned in that Wiſdom, I could not, in and by that Wiſdom, experimentally and knowingly, have ſet forth to others, the way that God makes uſe of to reſtore loſt man again unto himſelf, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:152785:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>God hath hid it from the wiſe and prudent, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it unto babes: for ſo it ſeemeth good in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſight,</hi> Luke 10. 21.</p>
            <p>The thing that I aim at in what I write, is, that the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent given to me might not be hid, but improved for him that gave it me; in my diſcovering what I by experience know of Mans being made in the Image of God: And how Man made a wrong uſe of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Knowledge that God gave to Man in his Creation, as made in his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: And how the Serpent ſelf in man, at firſt was, and now is tempting Man in that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Knowledge that God hath given to Man, to perſwade man to pleaſe, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, and content himſelf more in what he underſtands and knows of God, than to yield obedience to God, according to what he knew of God, that he ſhould obey God in.</p>
            <p>God commanded man that he ſhould not eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil; that is, he ſhould not pleaſe, ſatisfie and content himſelf in that he knew God, and knew what was God's declared Will, that he ſhould do which was good; and knew what was God's declared Will, that he ſhould not do that was evil, he was not to do evil; of this Tree man was commanded not to eat of, nor to touch the Fruit of it: And God commanded man to eat of the Tree of Life which was in the midſt of the Garden, which was <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that in man that ſaved man from ſin, that brought forth the Fruit of Obedience unto God, according to that underſtanding and knowledge that God had given to man to obey him in; this man was to eat freely of. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what I know of Gods love to all fallen men, and how he will bring loſt man again to himſelf, by chuſing them to take up the Croſs and follow Jeſus.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152785:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>When I at firſt began to write ſome part hereof, I began upon half a ſheet of Paper, and had no thoughts to write more than what might have been writ upon half a ſheet of Paper; and that onely concerning what <hi>Adam,</hi> the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Garden, the Serpetn, the forbidden Fruit, the eating of the forbidden Tree, and the death that Man died in the day that he eat thereof; what theſe were in the myſtery: as knowing that no Scripture is of any private interpretation, nor had I at firſt any thoughts of printing.</p>
            <p>But God, of whom I earneſtly begged to aſſiſt me in what I then was moved to write, reſigning my will wholly up into his will, in what I did, he hath cauſed me to exceed that bounds (which then I thought to have left onely in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;) and what I have writ, is according as he was pleaſed to put into me, and move in me to write, without obſerving any outward forms, rules, or methods in writing, (as is uſed by men ſo to do.) Are not the Scriptures ſo written, without the obſerving of outward rules and methods?</p>
            <p>God having herein, in what meaſure he pleaſed, lighted his Candle in me, he made known to me, that it was not to be put under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick; that ſo as an Inſtrument it may be a light to others. And in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, I knowing no other way to do it in, to avoid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but by being at the charge of putting it in print; and ſo thereby to communicate it to my Children, Friends, and Acquaintance; and thereby it may remain as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in Gods hand, to be as an help to ſhew to others how ſubtile the Serpents ſelf is in man, to draw man into diſobedience to God, and that under a pretence of profit or gain that man ſhall get by his diſobedience, in that
<pb facs="tcp:152785:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> thereby he ſhall become the more like unto God, to be as Gods: Which ſubtilty of the Serpent man cannot ſee, but as he comes into the obedience of Jeſus, the true Light in him; and ſo come to know how God ſaves man again out of his diſobedience, and bring man again into himſelf: Which being outwardly printed, may outwardly remain, when outwardly ſhall not be</p>

            <head>A FREE GIFT, Freely given of GOD TO Henry Abbut, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do believe there was an <hi>Adam,</hi> a man made by God, and out of that man God took a woman, and gave her to that man that he had made (of whom came all mankind) and they lived together as Gods Creatures, and for a time obeyed God in all things that he required of them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him in; but they did not continue in their Obedience, but ſinned againſt God, (and ſo do all men and women: <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 John 1. 8.) But for their ſin they did not die a natural death of the body, in that natural day of the week that they firſt ſinned in: And had they not ſinned, I believe they had never died the natural death of the body. And I do believe the outward <hi>Adam,</hi> and woman, and the outward death, are Figures, and in a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they repreſent an inward <hi>Adam,</hi> woman, and death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam,</hi> in the myſtery, is Jeſus; the woman, in the myſtery, is mans being drawn by the Spirit, or the leadings or goings forth of man by the Spirit of Jeſus in man. As the woman was taken out of man, and given to man to be an Help-meet for him; ſo is man by the drawings of the Spirit, or the goings or leadings forth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152785:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> of man by the Spirit of Jeſus in man; they are taken out of Jeſus and given as Help-meets for the life of Jeſus in man.</p>
            <p>When I ſpeak of the Life of Jeſus in man, I do not mean that eternal Life and Being that gave life and being to all things; for that Life and Being, the works or actions of man cannot reach unto to do it either good or harm: but I mean the Life of Jeſus as a Saviour in man; as he is ſent of the Father, and is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fallen man, (and is of that eternal Life and being that gave being to all); that life of his that was ſlain in man by ſin, and is come again into man to be raiſed up to life; and thereby to ſave man from ſin, and to bring man to God, and into God again, from whence man fell by his ſin. And ſo as man keeps in obedience to his being drawn or led forth by the Spirit of Jeſus in him, ſo he in his obedience being thereunto led or drawn forth by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt in him, is as an Help-meet for that life of Jeſus in him, to ſave him from ſin, (which the woman given to <hi>Adam</hi> as an Help-meet, I believe was a figure of.) And mans going out of his obedience in the time of the drawings or ſtrivings of the Spirit of Jeſus in him, is a hurt or hindrance to that Life of Jeſus in him; that is, to that Life that is a ſaving him from ſin: And ſo that which was as an Help-meet, is deceived by the ſubtilty of the Serpents ſelf; that in man that yielded obedience to God, is deceived in and by its diſobedience.</p>
            <p>God's Spirit ſtriving in man to keep him from ſin, that is, God's drawing of man; and as man keeps in obedience to thoſe ſtrivings and drawings of the Spirit of God in him, ſo he becomes an Help-meet to the Life of Jeſus in him; that is, to that Life that ſaves from ſin. The end of <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching, was to bring men to <hi>repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance,</hi> Acts 26. 20. And it was Gods Command by the Apoſtle, to <hi>work out our own ſalvation with fear and trembling. For it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure,</hi> Philip. 2. 12, 13. Every one is to work out their own ſalvation with fear and trembling: But how are they to work out their own ſalvation? It muſt be according to the ſtrivings or drawings of the Spirit of God in them to do it: <hi>For it is God that worketh in us to will and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> The work is God's; but he doth not do it, without man working with him; and as God choſe man to work with him, ſo he makes man as an Help-meet for the Life of Jeſus in man, to ſave man from ſin, as man yields an obedience
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152785:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the working of God in him: but when man goes out of his obedience, and yields not obedience to the working of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in him, then the woman is deceived and found in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
            <p>While the woman ſtood in obedience to the ſtrivings or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit of God in her, which ſtrove in her to keep her from yielding to the temptations of the Serpent, and cauſed her to reſiſt the temptations of the Serpent, telling him, that they <hi>might eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree in the midſt of the garden, God had ſaid, they ſhould not eat of it, nor touch it, leſt ye die.</hi> While the woman ſtood thus in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the working of the Spirit of God in her, that ſtrove in her to keep her from ſinning, ſhe was, as God wrought it in her, an Help-meet for the preſerving of the Life of Jeſus in her that kept her from ſin: But while the Spirit of God thus wrought and ſtrove in her, ſhe hearkened to the Serpents temptation, and went out of her obedience into diſobedience; then ſhe was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and found in the tranſgreſſion, as all men in the ſtate of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience are.</p>
            <p>How doth experience teach the truth of this! at this very day the ſubtile Serpent preſents to man his temptation. The Light, the Spirit, which is Jeſus, although in ſeveral names, yet but one Being, God makes known to man that what the Serpent tempts to, is a breaking of his Commands; and the penalty that follows the breaking of the Command, is death. This is the ſtriving or drawing of God by his Spirit in man, to keep man from ſin (this was in the woman.) While man ſtands in obedience to theſe ſtrivings or drawings of God in him, he is kept from ſin, (and ſo was the woman:) And as man is thus an Inſtrument in Gods hand, for God doth not ſave man from ſin, without mans joyning, condeſcending, or being willing thereunto; and although the work be wholly Gods, <hi>who worketh both to will and to do,</hi> yet God doth not do this his great work, without his Inſtrument man. And as man is an Inſtrument in Gods hand, ſo God makes him a fit Inſtrument to do his work withal. And ſo man may be ſaid to be an Help-meet for the work of God in man; as a man that hath a work to do, makes an Inſtrument fit to do his work with, and ſo his Inſtrument is an Help-meet or fit for him to do his work withal.</p>
            <p>God ſtrives or draws in man by his Light, his Spirit, his Son
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152785:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> Jeſus, to keep man from yielding to the temptation of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. The Serpent alſo then ſtrives in man, and draws in man to yield to his temptation; (this was the cauſe of the woman.) The Serpent in his temptation cauſeth man to behold a good and pleaſantneſs to be had in the ſin, in the forbidden Fruit, (the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaw that the Tree was good for food, and pleaſant to the eye.) When the underſtanding part in man, the knowing part in man, beheld a good for food, and pleaſantneſs to the eye, in what was contrary to the Command of God, and that there was ſo much good and pleaſantneſs in it, that he ſhall thereby have content and full ſatisfaction, as being wiſe as Gods. Then there is a deſire in the mind ſtirred up after the enjoying of it: (this was the caſe of the woman, when ſhe ſaw the Tree to be good for food, and pleaſant to the eye; then there was a deſire ſtirred up in her to take thereof to be made wiſe thereby.) So when the underſtanding and knowing part in man looketh out and ſees that there is a good, a pleaſantneſs, a ſatisfaction, and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in what God hath forbidden man to do, and that thereby he ſhall be made as Gods; then a deſire gets up in the mind to get the enjoyment thereof, that he may be wiſe as Gods, that is, that he may know what good, what pleaſure, what ſatisfaction, what content there is to be had in the doing the thing that God hath forbidden to be done. And ſo mans deſire is to be wiſe in that God hath forbidden him to do, and to know what God would not have him to know. And when man, in the underſtanding and knowing part, thus beheld what God had forbidden, and the deſire of the mind is let out after it; then the will joyns with the deſire of the mind, and as a hand, takes of the forbidden fruit and eats thereof, that is, does what God hath forbidden him to do; (this was the caſe of the woman) and this is the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man at this day.</p>
            <p>The underſtanding and knowing part in man, is that which knew this is good, and this man ought to do; and that is evil, and that man ought not to do. This was in the woman; ſhe knew that it was good to eat of the Trees of the Garden, and that ſhe ought to do it; and that it was an evil to eat of the Tree in the midſt of the Garden, and that ſhe ought not to do. (Man's knowing of what was good, and what was evil, was the Tree; and it was in man, and was not forbidden to be in man; and ſo it was no ſin, but to eat of it was forbidden: The doing of what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152785:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> God hath forbidden man to do, was and is the ſin; but the knowing of what God hath forbidden man to do, was no ſin, nor is no ſin.) And although the woman thus underſtood and knew, and the knowledge did not depart from her, for when ſhe had ſinned, her eyes were open, and ſhe ſaw her ſelf naked; that is, that ſhe ſaw that ſhe had done what ſhe ought not to do: Jeſus was the Light in her that gave her this underſtanding and knowledge, as he is the Light in all men, and gives them the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge to know this is good, and this they ought to do; and that is evil, and that they ought not to do: And this, as a Tree, remains ſtill in all men.</p>
            <p>But this underſtanding and knowledge cannot properly be ſaid to be Jeſus, the Light; but it is a gift of God in this Jeſus the Light given to man, as he is the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. As a Candle that lighteth the houſe, and may be ſaid to light all the houſe, or all in the houſe; ſo Jeſus the true Light is in man, and lighteth man. And yet the Light, the underſtanding and knowledge that man hath from this Light, is as the light in the houſe is from the Candle being in the houſe; ſo is that Light that man hath, whereby he knows this is good, and this he ought to do; and that is evil, and that he ought not to do. This Light came from Jeſus, the true Light in man; and this Light does not depart from man, but after man hath departed from his obeying of it; this Light remains in man, ſhewing him his diſobedience. And although this Light conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the woman (as a meaſure of it is in all men) and the woman knew that to obey God was good, and to diſobey God was evil; yet although ſhe thus underſtood and knew, ſhe in the wrong uſe of this underſtanding and knowledge ſaw a good for food in the Tree that God had forbidden to be eaten of; and that good for food, was that ſhe apprehended that in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what God had forbidden her to enjoy, ſhe ſhould have full content and ſatisfaction, (as being wiſe as Gods) like as the natural body is fully contented and ſatisfied with natural food: And this was pleaſing to that eye that ſo beheld it.</p>
            <p>God did not give the gift of his Son Jeſus to be a Light in man, to that end that Gods gift to man of his Son Jeſus, the true Light, which did and doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world, was, that man ſhould improve this gift in obedience to him. This was the end of Gods giving this gift as a Portion to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152785:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> man; but man, as a prodigal ſon, miſ-ſpent his Portion, and made uſe of it in diſobedience to God: As a man that gives his ſon a Portion to the end that he ſhould improve it, and in the uſe of it live to the honour of the Father that gave him it; but the ſon miſ-ſpends the Portion in evil courſes, as did the prodigal, to the diſhonour of the Father that gave it him. So was Gods gift to man of his Son Jeſus, the Light given to man, to that end that man in the light that he received from the true Light, Jeſus in him, and thereby come to that underſtanding and knowledge of what was good, that man ought to do; and in the underſtanding and knowing what was evil, that man ought not to do; that ſo man in this underſtanding and knowledge ſhould have honoured God as a Father in his obedience, in doing thoſe things that God hath made known to him and in him to be his will that he ſhould obey him in. But man like a prodigal ſon, diſhonoured God his Father in and with that portion of underſtanding and knowledge that God had given to him in and by his diſobedience.</p>
            <p>That underſtanding and knowing part in man that ſaw and beheld a good for food, and thereby to be made wiſe as Gods, and a pleaſantneſs to the eye, in the Tree that God had forbidden to be eaten of, that cauſed the deſire of the mind after it; and the deſire of the mind puts forward the will to take and eat thereof. And theſe three are all but one, and make up that body or being it ſelf; they are not to be ſeparated, but onely as they are known by their ſeveral workings and actions, and make up but that one body ſelf in man.</p>
            <p>He that will be true to himſelf, and to the Light of God in him, he may by experience find the truth of it in himſelf, how they are one and agree in one: for no ſooner doth the eye of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and knowing part in man behold what God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, to be good for food, to make them wiſe as Gods, and pleaſant to the eye, but the deſire of the mind is let out after it, and the will joyns therewith, and as an hand, takes it, and ſo it is eaten; that is, the ſin is committed in the heart or inward part of man, although perhaps there may never be an outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, as to the view or knowledge of others; and if it be outwardly known, the outward manifeſtation thereof may be done at ſeveral diſtances of time, as opportunity ſerves: But within in the heart or inward part of man, it is all done at once, and God looks on it as the eating of the forbidden Fruit, when that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152785:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> eye of the underſtanding and knowing part in man beheld it as good for food, and thereby to be made wiſe as Gods, and pleaſing to it, and the deſire of the mind is let out after it, and the will joyns with the deſire, and ſo it becomes a ſin in Gods ſight, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there never be the leaſt appearance of it without. And this is according to what Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat. 5. 27, 28. Ye have heard it hath been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery. But I ſay unto you, That whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> Mark here the eye firſt looks upon her, which muſt imply, that it ſo looks upon her as to be good to ſatisfie and pleaſe him, and then luſt the deſire is ſtirred up after her, and the will that condeſcends, and then the adultery is already committed in the heart, although no outward action ever be manifeſted tending thereunto. And what Chriſt ſpake of an outward woman, may be ſaid of all outward Creatures: When the eye of the underſtanding and knowing part in man, doth look upon any Creature, otherwiſe than it is Gods will that man ſhould look upon them, and the deſire of the mind be let out after them, contrary to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>clared will of God which was given to man before his fall; and the will joyns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that it will have its deſire ſatisfied in the enjoyment of them, although contrary to Gods command to man. Here the inward adultery is committed with the Creatures, although there come none of it forth into outward action. And this is a kind of inward and ſpiritual whoredom committed in the heart or inward part in man.</p>
            <p>And this underſtanding and knowing part in man which looks upon what God hath forbidden, to be good food for it, to be thereby made wiſe as Gods, and ſo pleaſing to it, and the deſire of the mind to be let out after it, and the will condeſcending and takes it in and eats of it; that is, doth the things that God hath forbidden to be done. Theſe three thus joyned together in one, as they are but one, this is that which is the Antichriſt in man; it is that which oppoſeth God in his workings by his Son Jeſus in man, for the bringing man again to God. And it is that man of ſin in man, the Son of Perdition, that is to be revealed, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God, and is the myſtery of iniquity. And this is he that letteth and will let, until he be taken away; and when he is taken away,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152785:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> then his wickedneſs is revealed, then is he made manifeſt what he was; that is, when Jeſus is a conſuming of him with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his mouth, and the brightneſs of his coming in the heart of man. And then, whereas before the coming of Jeſus in man, and is in man thus a conſuming of this man of ſin, he that is the man of ſin, until Jeſus is a conſuming of him, lieth hid in the heart or inward part of man, and is not known to man what he is, but ſitteth in Gods Temple in man as God, and man boweth down to him and worſhippeth him as his God, whom the Lord Jeſus ſhall (yea he does, as experience teacheth us) conſume him with the Spirit of his mouth, and deſtroy him with the brightneſs of his coming.</p>
            <p>Men have a long time been looking without them, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring without them, who that man of ſin ſhould be, and what he is that is to be revealed, and ſo to be revealed, whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſignes, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, and with all deceiveableneſs and unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, becauſe they receive not the love of the Truth that they might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aved: And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all may be damned who believe not the truth, but had pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſay, their ſo-much-looked-out for the man of ſin to be revealed without them, that is it that hath hindered that they have not ſeen the revelation of him within them: For what is there ſpoken of the man of ſin, but the ſame may be found in that underſtanding and knowing part in man, that ſaw and beheld a good for food, and thereby to be made wiſe as Gods, and a pleaſantneſs to the eye in the Tree that God had forbidden to be eaten thereof, and the deſire of the mind after it, and the will to take and eat of it? Joyn theſe three together in one, as indeed they are but one, and make but one man ſin, for they all were joyned and united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſin, and eating of the forbidden Fruit, and ſo may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called the man of ſin, becauſe they begot the firſt ſin in man. And ſee if you do not find in theſe, as they are joyned and united together, all that is ſpoken of the man of ſin, in 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. No prophecy of ſcripture is of any private interpretation,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 20.</p>
            <p>The Garden, in the myſtery, is the heart of man, or the inward part of man, that was Gods garden. While <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152785:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> obedience to God, the heart or inward part of <hi>Adam</hi> was pleaſant and delightful to God, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s hearts delight was in God, and his obedience to God was pleaſant unto him; and ſo the heart or inward part of man doth very fitly reſemble a Garden which is a pleaſant and delightful place. In this Garden, in the heart or inward part of man, <hi>Adam,</hi> after he had fallen, in the cool of the day heard God's voice walking in the heart or inward part (as man in the fallen ſtate doth at this day) and calling to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> And his eyes being opened, he knew that he was naked; (which cannot be meant the outward eyes of his body, for they were open before, and he ſaw his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward body before;) but the eyes of his underſtanding were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he ſaw himſelf naked for want of that righteous Garment of obedience that God had clothed him with in the Creation; which Garment remained upon him, and he was clothed with it, until he eat of the forbidden Fruit; and when he had eaten of the forbidden Fruit, then he ſaw himſelf naked, ſtripped out of that righteous Garment of obedience that God had created him in. And then when he heard God's voice walking in his heart or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part (which before he eat of the forbidden Fruit, was pleaſing to him) but after he had eaten of the forbidden Fruit, he was afraid of God's voice, and hid himſelf from God, fearing Gods juſtice that he ſaw he juſtly deſerved for his ſin (as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth us in the fallen ſtate and condition of man, at this very day, as man remains in that fallen ſtate.) And thus when man had ſinned, the heart or inward part of man, that which was before life, a garden for delight and pleaſantneſs, is become like a Hell, a place of fear, dread, and torment: And indeed that fear that was then in mans heart or inward part, when he heard God's voice walking in the garden, was the beginning of Hell in man. And here God may be ſaid to ſend man or drive man out of the garden; that is, as man in his own apprehenſions looked upon God to be like himſelf, that is, as he had changed himſelf in his obedience to God, ſo man in that falſe ſight that he then had of God, looked upon God that he had changed his love to him, and ſo man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held himſelf as ſent or drove from the preſence of God, and turned out of the garden, out of Gods love and delight that he had in man. And the reaſon why man ſo looked upon God to have no love nor delight in him, in his fallen ſtate, was becauſe man in his diſobedience he found no love nor delight that he had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152785:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> in himſelf towards God; and ſo he judged God to be changed towards him, as he had changed himſelf towards God: when in truth, the change was onely in man. And ſo man may be ſaid to ſend, drive, or turn himſelf out of the Garden, where man in the fallen ſtate is, and ſo do continue out of the Garden until there is a change wrought in the heart of man, by being brought to a knowledge of God's unchangeableneſs, that although man by his diſobedience turned enemy to God, yet love continued in God towards man. <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> God's love was ſo great to man, too great for the tongue of man to expreſs, or the heart of man to conceive of, <hi>that he gave his onely begotten ſon, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believed in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>God commended his love towards us, that while we were ſinners, Chriſt died for us. When we were enemies, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the death of his ſon,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. 10. Theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſhew the unchangeableneſs of God's love to man; which until man comes in ſome meaſure or degree to be made ſenſible of the unchangeableneſs of God's love, the fear of God's juſtice for ſin, continues in the heart of man, and man continues out of the Garden, and a true love to God is wanting in the heart of man.</p>
            <p>But when that Change is wrought in the heart, that we love God becauſe he firſt loved us, then man cometh again into the Garden, and man obeys God, becauſe God hath made known his love to him: and therefore he loves God again, and then the heart or inward part in man, is pleaſing and delightful to God; man's delight is to obey God. 1 John 4. 18, 19. <hi>There is no fear in love, but perfect love caſteth out fear; becauſe fear hath torment: he that feareth, is not made perfect in love. We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> Here is the true ſtate of man in the Fall, and of his being reſtored again: When man by his tranſgreſſion had loſt his love to God, then the fear of God entered into his heart, and that cauſed or brought forth torment; and as long as fear continued in mans heart, mans love is not made perfect to God, and mans love is made perfect to God by our loving of him, <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> and then mans heart or the inward part in man, cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be as a pleaſant and delightful Garden.</p>
            <p>The Tree of knowledge of good and evil, as in the myſtery, God made man, and as a gift, God gave to man the knowledge of himſelf that he was his God: And God alſo gave to man the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152785:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> knowledge of his revealed will, that what God had commanded man to do, was God's will that he ſhould do; and what God had made known of himſelf in man, and what was God's revealed will in man, that he ſhould do in obedience to him, was good: and ſo God gave to man the knowledge of what was good. And God gave alſo to man the knowledge of his revealed will of what God had commanded him not to do; and what was Gods revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will in man, that God had commanded man not to do, that was evil; and ſo God gave to man the knowledge of what was evil: And this was in mans heart or the inward part of man, which in the myſtery was God's Garden. And this knowledge of good and evil, in the myſtery, is a Tree remaining in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in the heart or inward part of man; and in this knowledge of what was good, and what was evil, man for a time ſtood in his obedience to God, obeying God in the doing all that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to do; and obeying God in the leaving undone all that he had forbidden him to do. And while man in this his knowledge ſtood thus in obedience to God, in doing all that God had commanded him to do, and in leaving undone all that God had commanded him not to do; man knew no will in him of his own, but mans will was wholly reſigned up into Gods will; man willed nothing but what God willed in him; and what God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in man, that man willed in God; and man knew no other will but the will of God: and ſo God was all, and in all man.</p>
            <p>And man was the Paradiſe, the delight of God; and God was the Paradiſe, the delight of man: And out of the ground that the Lord God had made man of, <hi>the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleaſant to the ſight, and good for food: the tree of life alſo in the midſt of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. 9. The Tree of Life is Jeſus, the Light of God in man; and this Tree was alſo in the midſt of the garden: the garden is the heart or inward part of man, which the Lord God planted Eaſtward, which is the place of the riſing of the Sun; which is as much as to ſay, God ſo placed the heart or inward part in man his garden, that it ſhould be in the place wherein the riſing of his Son Jeſus, the true Light in man, did riſe; and as a Tree there to grow and be in the midſt of his garden, and the Tree of knowledge of good and evil. I pray obſerve the words of the Scripture: <hi>The tree of life alſo in the midſt of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</hi> See how near the Tree of knowledge of good and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152785:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> evil, is placed to the Tree of life; there is but (<hi>and</hi>) between them, and that (<hi>and</hi>) makes them two Trees; and ſo indeed they are: The Tree of Life is one, which is Jeſus the true Light of God in man; and the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, is another; and they are ſo near joyned together, that there is but an (<hi>and</hi>) that parts them: Jeſus the Word of God, the true Light in man, gave man the knowledge of what was Gods will that he ſhould do, and that was good, man was to do good; and the ſame Jeſus the Word of God in man, gave man the knowledge of what he ſhould not do, and that was evil, man was not to do evil. And theſe two Trees were very nearly joyned together in Gods garden, in the heart of man; and ſo a meaſure of them do continue ſo nearly joyned together at this day, that would man be true to himſelf, and the Light of God in him, he might ſee them to be both in him, and how nearly they are joyned together in him.</p>
            <p>While man was thus in Gods garden, and theſe two Trees in him, and he kept by Jeſus the Light of God in him, in obeying of God according to that knowledge that God had given him of his revealed will, in doing what God had commanded him to do, and in leaving undone what God had forbidden him to do: In his thus obeying God, man eat of the Tree of life, and lived; he lived in God, in obedience to God, knowing nothing but the will of God, and doing nothing but the will of God. Mans know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of evil, as it became a ſin in man, was mans not continuing in obeying God, in doing the things that he knew God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to do: This was the actual knowing of evil, the knowing of evil by the doing of evil, and that was ſin. The Tree was knowledge, and while obedience was joyned to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it was a good Tree as God had placed it in the heart or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of man; but when diſobedience was joyned to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then it became an evil Tree; then man eat of the Tree whereof God had commanded him that he ſhould not eat of. And mans diſobedience came from ſelf-ends, a will and deſire that was in them to be wiſer than God had made them, and to have another likeneſs of God than that Image that God had created them in; their deſire was not to be in Gods Image as he had made them, but to be as Gods in knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Serpent, in the myſtery, is mans ſelf, or mans will, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from God, and this is that which was more ſubtile
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152785:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> than any Beaſt of the Field that God had made. God made all the Beaſts of the Field, and they were good; From whence then came this more ſubtile Beaſt? (it may bare the name of Beaſt, that mans will as it is revealed from Gods will, becauſe of the foul, unclean, and evil beaſtly nature that was in it;) it was not of Gods creating, becauſe it was not good; if it had been good, it could not have tempted to the knowledge of evil in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evil, that is, it could not have tempted man to diſobey God; ſelf in man, or a mans own will ſeparated from God, is more ſubtile to tempt man than all the Beaſts of the Field that God hath made; that is, ſelf in man or a mans own will, is more ſubtile to prevail with man to diſobey God, than all without him can prevail with him to diſobey God. <hi>James</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15. 13 verſe, <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man;</hi> (that is, God tempts no man to evil, and as God is good, ſo are all the Creatures that he hath made; and as they are good, and the creation of God, ſo the Creatures they cannot tempt man to evil.) 14 verſe, <hi>But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed.</hi> (Mark, that which tempts man to ſin, and entice him to ſin, it is ſomething of his own: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls it <hi>luſt,</hi> that is, the height of deſire: in <hi>Geneſis</hi> it is called <hi>deſire,</hi> a Tree to be deſired to make wiſe: And does not luſt, the height of deſire to be made wiſe in what God hath forbidden, come from ſelf in man.) 15 verſe, <hi>Then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin, and ſin, when it is finiſhed, it bringeth forth death.</hi> The compariſon is taken from natural conceptions and bringings forth: That which conceives, is of its own; it is ſomething with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that conceives, it is an inward act, and not an act without them; and conception is before bringing forth; and what is brought forth, is of the ſame kind with that which conceived: what then can be more plainer than that, that the Serpent that tempts to ſin, is ſelf, or a mans own will in ſeparation from God, or ſomething of mans ſelf that draweth him forth into diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to what he knew to be the mind and will of God for him to do; and the gain that he expects by his diſobedience (is to be wiſe) to pleaſe himſelf?</p>
            <p>There is nothing Gods oppoſite or enemy, but what God hath forbidden; all that God created, he made very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. God did not make the Devil a Devil, if the Devil be a fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152785:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> as many believe him to be; and ſo before he fell he was an Angel as other Angels are, miniſtring Spirits; ſo was mans will, and all that was in man in the creation was an Angel a miniſtring Spirit, and miniſtred, that is, waited or attended upon Gods will, as the Angels do; but when the temptation entred into man, and then when man by the temptation was overcome, and deſired to be as Gods. Then the miniſtration of the will of man fell from the miniſtration that it had before in the creation, to wait or attend upon the will of God: and ſo the will of man it became a fallen Angel, a fallen Miniſtration, a fallen Spirit. The Angels they are miniſtring Spirits, attending upon the will of God; ſo was the will of man, and all that was in man in his creation, was a miniſtring Spirit attending upon the will of God: But when that which was more ſubtile than any Beaſt of the Field that God had made, entred into Gods garden, (that is, into mans heart or the inward part of man) and man yielding to the temptation, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be as Gods, that is, to do his own will, and not to do Gods will; then entred into mans heart the Devil. See the truth of it, John 8. 44. <hi>Ye are of your father the devil, and the luſt of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh a lye, he ſpeaketh of his own: for he is a lyar, and the father of it.</hi> Chriſt here tells the Jews, they were of their Father the Devil, and the luſt of your Father ye will do; luſt is the great deſire of the heart after the forbidden Fruit which is of the Devil, he is the Father of it, he is the begetter of it; the Devil, called the Serpent, was the Father that begot the deſire after the forbidden Fruit. And Chriſt alſo told the Jews, that <hi>he was a murderer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and abode not in the truth.</hi> If the Devil were not once in the truth, then how can it be ſaid, he did not abide in it? Mans ſelf or will, all that was in man, was once in the truth, as God is the truth, in God, in Gods will, as God created man and made him good; but mans will, it abode not in the truth that is in God, for God is the truth; it abode not in the doing Gods will, but went into the doing its own will, and ſo murdered the Life of God in man, that is, murdered Jeſus the innocent Lamb of God, which was in man to preſerve and keep him from ſin; and ſo Jeſus was the innocent Life in man, as he kept man from ſin; as appears by Jeſus telling the woman what was Gods will that they ſhould do, <hi>they might eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152785:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> garden:</hi> and what was Gods will that they ſhould not do; <hi>but of the fruit of the tree in the midſt of the garden, God hath ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it:</hi> And the penalty that would fall upon them if they did not Gods will therein, it was, that they ſhould die. This was Jeſus the true Light in man, that gave the Serpent this anſwer. And Jeſus did for a time preſerve man from yielding to the temptation: for the woman did not eat of the forbidden Fruit preſently, as ſoon as the Serpent tempted her to eat of it, but as ſoon as ſhe had eaten thereof, Jeſus the Lamb of God, the innocent Life that was before in them, was ſlain in them; Jeſus that had preſerved them from ſin, was ſlain in them; that is, as to their obedience to God, ſo was he ſlain in them; but not ſlain in them as the Light to make known their ſin to them, nor as he was a Judge to condemn them for their ſin: ſo Jeſus continued alive in them, as appears in that their eyes were opened, and they ſaw themſelves naked, and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of God. And Jeſus told the Jews the reaſon why the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil did not abide in the truth; the Devil <hi>abode not in the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh a lye, he ſpeaketh his own: for he is a lyar and the father of it.</hi> That which is a lye, is of the Devil, and it is the Devil, and ſo the Devil entered into man in the lye that was in the temptation; and there can be no truth in a lye, and therefore a lye cannot abide in the truth, it cannot have a being in God; all deceit or deceiving is a lye, and is of the Devil, and indeed it is the Devil, becauſe it is truths oppoſite, and truth is God, and God is truth; and God which is truth, was firſt, and was before there was deceit or lye: for there was in the beginning (mark that) when there was, and was nothing but God, nothing but truth; where then was the Devil? But the Devil abode not in the truth, he was a murderer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; which cannot be meant from the beginning of time, for then the Devil was not a Devil, God made all things good; but the beginning of the Devil, was the murdering or ſlaying in man, Jeſus that preſerved man from ſin; that is, it ſlew Jeſus as to mans obedience or obeying that in him which kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved man in the doing the will of God, and ſo kept man from ſin. And man was brought into diſobedience to God, by lying, by deceiving was the innocent life in man (that did God's will in man) ſlain. And this was the beginning of the Devil in man, which abode not in the truth, he went out of the truth, and there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152785:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> is no truth in that which goes out of the truth; all that is out of the truth, out of God, is a lye, is deceit, is the Devil. And thus by theſe two Scriptures it doth plainly appear, that man was tempted by ſomething within him; and mans temptation was the entring of the Devil into mans heart, and that the Serpent was not an outward Creature, as many do think or ſuppoſe it to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the ſerpent being more ſubtile than any beaſt of the field that the Lord God had made,</hi> he gets into the Lords Gods garden; or elſe how could he ſpeak in man, when man was in the garden of the Lord God? Before the temptation entred into the garden of God, into the heart or inward part in man, man knew no will that he had of his own; man was in his Virgins ſtate, he knew nothing of man, he knew nothing of himſelf, nor of any will that he had of his own; he onely knew God, and knew Gods will, and that will he had, was wholly reſigned up into Gods will, and did nothing but Gods will: but after he had yielded to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then his eyes were opened, and he then ſaw himſelf to be naked; man with his outward eyes ſaw his outward body before he was tempted; but after he had yielded to the temptation, then his eyes were opened, and he ſaw himſelf in that outward body which before he did not ſee, (before he yielded to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he ſaw nor knew nothing of himſelf;) but after he had yielded to the temptation, his eyes being opened, he knew himſelf naked, that is, he knew himſelf naked, ſtripped of the righteous garment God in the Creation made him in; he then beheld ſelf in him, and ſelf that ſet him preſently at work to make himſelf Aprons to cover their nakedneſs with, of the leaves of the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, the Tree Jeſus curſed, becauſe he found no fruit on it.</p>
            <p>It is no ſin to be tempted; Jeſus, as man, was tempted, and yet did not ſin: And when he taught his Diſciples to pray, he did not teach them to pray that they might not be tempted, but he taught them to pray that they might not be led into the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to be led into the temptation, that is a ſin, to yield to the temptation, that is a ſin. Jeſus, as man, had a will in him that cauſed him to pray, that if it were poſſible that Cup might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him. And he had a will in him that cauſed him to pray to the Father, that that will of his that would have had the Cup taken from him, ſhould not be done; but that that will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be done, that would have him to drink of the Cup.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152785:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> And in all this Jeſus ſinned not, becauſe his will was reſigned up into the will of the Father, and not his will, but the will of the Father was to be done. I make mention of theſe two wills in Jeſus, to the end to help the underſtanding of that, that when the temptation entred into man, there might be two wills in man, and yet man, by the power of God in him, was kept from ſinning, kept from entring into the temptation, kept from yielding to the temptation, kept from eating of the forbidden Tree.</p>
            <p>When the temptation entred into the garden of God, into the heart or inward part in man, there was then ſomething in man that would have drawn man out of his obedience to God, into diſobedience to God. And this was that which the Tempter at firſt deſired, and that which at firſt would have drawn man out of his obedience to God, into diſobedience to God. This in time did do what at firſt it deſired to do, and ſo it did its own will: And that which at firſt would have brought man out of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, into diſobedience to God, was the ſame ſubtile Serpent, the ſame will that in time did its will, in bringing man out of obedience to God, into the diſobedience to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now this ſerpent was more ſubtile than any beaſt of the field that the Lord God had made.</hi> Man in the enjoyment of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Fiſh in the Sea, the Fowl of the Air, and the Cattel of all the Earth, and the creeping things that creep upon the Earth, all theſe did not tempt nor prevail with man to draw or take his will out of Gods will, in doing the things that God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do, and in leaving undone the things that God had commanded him not to do: But man in the enjoying and having dominion over all theſe, his will was kept in the doing of Gods will; and in the enjoying of all theſe, his will was wholly reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into Gods will, and to do what God would have him to do with them, he knew no will of his own in the enjoyment and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dominion over them all: for when God in his will brought to <hi>Adam</hi> every Beaſt of the Field, and every Fowl of the Air, to ſee what <hi>Adam</hi> would call them: <hi>whatſoever man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</hi> Thus was man kept in the enjoyment and having dominion over all Creatures, by Jeſus the Light of God in him, that none of them tempted him to draw his obedience from God, into diſobedience to God; but his will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued firm in the being reſigned up into Gods will, and kept in the doing of what God would have him to do; and he knew no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152785:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> other will but that will that did Gods will in him. But the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that was more ſubtile than any Beaſt of the Field, he gets into Gods garden, into the heart or inward part in man; and then there was ſomething in man that would have that done in man, that God had forbidden man to do; and this at length proved a will in man: for that which began the temptation in man, continued the temptation in him, till there was a willingneſs in man to yield to the temptation.</p>
            <p>Now the Serpent began his temptation very ſubtilly, and ſaid, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden?</hi> He puts it by way of queſtion, Whether it were ſo or no, that God had ſaid, they ſhould not eat of every Tree in the garden? To eat, is to take in content and ſatisfaction, as the natural body is contented and ſatisfied with eating outward food; ſo that was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, that man ſhould not eat, ſhould not content and ſatisfie himſelf with the Tree of knowledge of good and evil; that is, man ſhould not be contented and ſatisfied in that he knew what was Gods declared will that he ſhould do, and what was Gods declared will that he ſhould not do. This man was not to eat of, this man was not to content and ſatisfie himſelf in; but he was to eat freely of the other trees of the garden. Man was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to eat freely of the Tree of Life, of Jeſus, by which he was by his Spirit in him, led into obedience to the Commands of God, of this man was to feed freely of; that is, man might freely content and ſatisfie himſelf, in that he was drawn by the Spirit of God, the Light of Jeſus in him, into the obedience of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and in the doing thereof, he knew nothing of any will of his own, but was led and drawn thereunto by the will of God in him. And on this Tree he was freely to eat, freely to content and ſatisfie himſelf in.</p>
            <p>But if man, as to the outward doing of things, does thoſe things that God hath commanded him to do, and does them from the leadings or drawings of his own will in him, and feed upon this, content and ſatisfie himſelf with what he does in obedience to God, and done in his own will; this is the eating of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil: for although one part of it be good, as it is the doing of what God hath commanded, yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of it is evil, as it is a doing of what God hath forbidden: for <hi>God is a jealous God,</hi> and will not give his glory to another; God will not have mans will to be the leading or moving caſe.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152785:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> In the leading or drawing of man out to do God's will, in the doing what God hath commanded to be done, this God hath forbidden in man to be done; that is, God hath forbidden man to take his work out of his hands: for it is Gods work onely to work in man an obedience to himſelf; he muſt <hi>work both to will and to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſubtilty of the Serpent ſaid in man, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden?</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, Is there any Tree in the garden that God hath ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of? Is there any thing in the heart or inward part of man, that God hath ſaid, Man ſhall not eat of, man ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfie himſelf in? Oh how willing is man to eat of, to content and ſatisfie himſelf with what he finds to be in his own heart, or in the inward part of man; and eſpecially if he find any thing there that would be willing to be in the doing of any thing, as to the outward things, that he knew that God hath commanded him to do? How little then does man queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may not eat of this Fruit, content and ſatisfie himſelf in his doing of thoſe things that he knew that God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done? And ſo man, in the doing the things that God hath commanded to be done in his own will, to pleaſe, content, and ſatisfie himſelf in the doing of them; and man not waiting for the ſtrivings of the Spirit of God in him, to draw him forth in Gods will in the doing of thoſe things that God hath required of him to do, but mans doing of them in his own will, this is the eating of the forbidden Fruit; which the Serpent ſubtilly tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do in his doubtful Queſtion, Whether or no God had ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But man, in the woman, did not preſently yield to this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubtile Serpent, will in the woman had not gotten ſo much power over the man; but when the ſubtile Serpent preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his doubtful Queſtion in the woman, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden?</hi> Jeſus, the Word, the true Light of God in man, was then ſtriving in man to draw and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him from being led into the temptation: And ſo it was no ſin in man to be tempted; the ſin was in being led into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, that is, in yielding to the temptation; which for a time man was kept from by the ſtrivings of the Spirit of God in man, the drawings of the Spirit of Jeſus, the true Light in man, who in the woman gave this anſwer to the ſubtile Serpent: <hi>We may eat
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152785:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree that is in the midſt of the garden, God hath ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die.</hi> Here man, by the woman, in the help and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Jeſus, the Light in man that cauſed him to relate to the Serpent the Command of God in what was Gods revealed will to him, and in him, wherein he was to obey God, in doing what God had commanded him to do; and wherein he was to obey God, in what God had commanded him not to do: And hereby having his will kept and preſerved in the will of God, he reſiſted the temptation, and ſtood in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, feeding upon the Tree of Life in him.</p>
            <p>But the Serpent continuing his temptation, ſaid unto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened: and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> The Serpent had before asked the Queſtion in man, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?</hi> What could he willed or deſired in the asking of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but the drawing of man out of his obedience to God, into diſobedience? But the will at that time was not gotten to be ſo ſtrong in the man, as to prevail over man; but it was reſiſted by the power of God in man. (May I not ſay by the ſame power of God in man, that prayed, <hi>Father, not my will, but thy will be done?</hi>) Here began the ſtrife between the two wills in man; which <hi>Paul</hi> was ſenſible of, when he ſaid, <hi>The good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do,</hi> Rom. 7. God by his Spirit ſtrove in the will of man, that is, in that will of man which had yielded obedience to God in his Commands, and knew the doing of nothing elſe but of the Commands of God, and thereby draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man to keep man ſtill in obedience to his Commands. But another will appeared in man, that ſtrove to bring man out of his obedience to God in the keeping his Commands, into the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in not doing his Commands: for what can it be elſe but a will that ſtrove ſo much in man to bring man from his obedience into diſobedience? In the asking that Queſtion, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden?</hi> that which asked that Queſtion, it was that in man that after it had made a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, would not nor did not leave tempting of man, until it had brought man into diſobedience. An outward Serpent it could not be, becauſe he was one of the Creatures that God had given man dominion over; and God brought him to man to name,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152785:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> God made him ſubject to man; and man, in obedience to God, having rule and dominion over him, did name him. But beſides, that which makes it undeniable, that it was not an outward Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, is this, the ſeed of the woman, which on all hands is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, was to bruiſe the head of this Serpent that tempted man to eat of the forbidden Tree; and this Serpent that tempted man to eat of the Tree that God had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, was to bruiſe the heel of the ſeed of the woman; bruiſe the heel of Jeſus, bruiſe the heel of that which ſaves from ſin. And where can ye find in the Scriptures, or any where elſe, that ever Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, bruiſed the head of this outward Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? or that ever this outward Serpent bruiſed the heel of Jeſus, bruiſed the heel of that in man that ſaves man from ſin? But to this purpoſe ye may read in Scripture, that Jeſus in man that ſaves man from ſin, bruiſe the head of that will in man that tempt man to eat of the forbidden Fruit, that tempt man to do the things that God hath forbidden; as that you may read in the ſeventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of death?</hi> whereas before he made a great complaint of doing what he would not; he found a will in him drawing him to do that God had commanded him not to do; but he finds a remedy againſt that will, that bruiſed the head of that will, and that is Jeſus Chriſt. And this will in man is known to bruiſe the heel of Jeſus, that is, as Jeſus is in man a ſaving of man from ſin, and ſo bringing man into God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this will in man is ſtriving in man to hinder and hurt this work of Jeſus, as appears in the aforeſaid ſeventh of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeak ſomething to the words in the latter part of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of the Serpent, whereby he prevailed with the woman, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die;</hi> although the temptation did not at firſt prevail with the woman to queſtion the truth of what ſhe knew, whether or no God had ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden,</hi> yet in the continuing of the temptation, I believe he did at length prevail with the woman to queſtion the truth of it, whether God had ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden:</hi> or elſe how could he have prevailed with her to a belief that they <hi>ſhould not ſurely die</hi> if they did eat of it? For God had as ſurely ſaid, that they ſhould die in the day that they eat thereof, as he had ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of it;</hi> but the Serpent having cauſed in her a doubt or queſtion, whether or no God had ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of it,</hi> he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152785:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> her to believe, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> if they did eat of it. How can it be thought that the woman could believe the temptation; that they ſhould not ſurely die if they did eat of the forbidden Tree, being God had certainly ſaid, that they ſhould ſurely die in the day they eat of it, if ſhe had not firſt yielded to the temptation to doubt or queſtion the truth, whether God had ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden,</hi> and if they did, they ſhould ſurely die? Doth not experience teach the truth of this, that when the Tempter tempteth to do what God hath forbidden, that there is firſt a queſtion or a doubt got up in man, whether God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it or no? And if he cannot prevail ſo far, then to queſtion if it be forbidden, yet not ſo forbidden with ſuch ſtrictneſs and ſeverity as the Light of God in man doth at firſt diſcover it to be forbidden, that if they eat of it, in the day they eat of it they ſhall ſurely die, they ſhall ſurely receive a puniſhment from God for it. And then although there may not be altogether a yielding ſo fully to the temptation, as to queſtion or doubt wholly of the truth of the Command of God; yet there is a yielding ſo far to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to queſtion whether or no that God is ſo ſtrict or ſevere in his Command, as the Light of God at firſt makes known in man that he is. And then there is a belief got up in man, that he ſhall not ſurely die; that is, as God was not ſo ſtrict or ſevere in his Commands, ſo God will not be ſo ſtrict or ſevere in his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. And thus the Tempter perſwades man out of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that he had to God, which was in the believing the truth of what God had ſaid, into diſobedience to God in the believing the lye the Tempter ſaid.</p>
            <p>And when the Tempter had prevailed thus far with man, as to queſtion the truth of what God had ſaid, and brought man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God had not ſaid true in ſaying they ſhould ſurely die, but perſwaded man that <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die:</hi> Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds further in his temptation, and perſwades man to a belief that <hi>God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, your eyes ſhall be opened: and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter perſwades man not onely to believe that God had ſaid a lye, when he ſaid, in the day he eat thereof he ſhould ſurely die, (to die, is to ceaſe to be, as man is ſaid to die when he ceaſeth to be alive,) but the temptation perſwades man to believe that God knew that he lied when he ſaid, man ſhall ſurely die in the day he eat of the forbidden Tree. And this the Tempter did, in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152785:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> man to believe that <hi>God doth know, that in the day ye eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, your eyes ſhall be opened; and ye ſhall be as Gods:</hi> that is as much as to ſay, that God did know that man ſhould be ſo far from dying, that is, from ceaſing to be, that he ſhould have a more higher or greater Being than the Being he had before the Tempter entered into him: for the Being man had before the temptation entered into him, was but the Being of a Creature; but by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the temptation, the Tempter perſwades him to believe that he ſhould have a Being as God, <hi>ye ſhall be as Gods:</hi> and ſo he perſwades man to a belief that God did not onely lye when he ſpake the truth, in ſaying man ſhall ſurely die in the day he eat of the forbidden Tree; but that God did know he lyed, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the truth of it was, that all that God ſpake was that which was ſurely true as God is the truth. But the Tempter by his ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perſwades man to believe that God was ſuch a one as the Tempter was, that he was a lyar, and knew himſelf to be a lyar; when God had ſaid nothing but the truth, and the Tempter had ſaid nothing that was true, and that it was all lyes that he had ſaid, that is, that in and by his deceit he intended to deceive man in all that he ſaid to man. John 8. 44. <hi>He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh a lye, he ſpeaketh of his own: for he is a lyar, and the father of it.</hi> The Devil the Tempter, is the Father, the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of lyes, and is he that <hi>abode not in the truth,</hi> where once he was.</p>
            <p>And when the Tempter had prevailed thus far with man, to cauſe him to believe that God had not ſpoken true, and that God knew that he had not ſpoken true; then he perſwades man into a belief of the great profit, gain, and benefit that man ſhould have in the believing the Tempter the Serpent in his lyes, and in yielding to his temptation in his eating of the forbidden Tree, in his diſobedience to God; and that God did know that in the day ye eat thereof, he perſwaded man that God knew that all was to be as the Tempter the Serpent ſaid to man it ſhould be; that their eyes ſhould be opened, that the underſtanding and knowing part in man ſhould ſee and know that they ſhould <hi>be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How did God know good and evil, that man ſhould <hi>be as Gods, knowing good and evil,</hi> and that he ſhould be ſo by eating of the Tree God had forbidden to be eaten of, by doing that which God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152785:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> had forbidden man to do? Doth any one believe or think that God knew evil in doing contrary to his own declared will? If they do ſo believe or think, I believe they will not ſo ſpeak, but be like the fool, that ſays in his heart <hi>there is no God;</hi> in his heart he ſpeaks it, and in his heart he believes that God is not in his heart. But God did know good and evil, God did know his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will to man to be good; and God willed this declared will of himſelf, and of himſelf he willed this declared will of his to be done; there was no mover, no ſtirer, no drawer, to move, ſtir, or draw God to his will, or to the knowledge of his will to be good, nor to will his will to be done; there was no mover, no ſtirer, no drawer, to move, ſtir, or draw God, to do his declared will in man, and ſo to bring up mans will into his will, and to cauſe mans will to be reſigned up into the doing of Gods will. And in all this God knew good; and in Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good, he was abſolute in himſelf, there was nothing that could help him or move, ſtir, or draw him thereunto; and thus God was in knowing of good. God knew what was evil, God knew that the doing of what he had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be done, was evil; God new that it was evil, becauſe he had forbidden it: and thus God knew evil, as it was evil; but God did not know evil in the action, in the doing of what he had forbidden to be done.</p>
            <p>The Serpent by his temptation perſwaded man to believe that he ſhould be as God, to know good and evil; as God knew good and evil, ſo man ſhould know good and evil; God knew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will to man to be good of himſelf, God had none to give him the knowledge thereof: And ſo the Tempter perſwaded man that he ſhould know the will of God, as God knew it as God, of himſelf, and not as a Creature, to have his knowledge thereof from another. And God willed his declared will of himſelf, and ſo the Tempter perſwaded man that he ſhould be as God, to will Gods declared will of himſelf, and not as a Creature, to have his will brought to will Gods will by the motion, ſtirring, drawings, or the work of another in him. And God of himſelf, he willed his declared will of his to be done; and ſo the Tempter he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man that he ſhould be as God, and not as a Creature; and that of himſelf he ſhould will Gods declared will to be done. God had none that moved, ſtirred, and drew in God to his will, or to the knowledge of his will to be good, or to will his will to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152785:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> be done; and ſo the Tempter perſwaded man that he ſhould be as God, and not as a Creature, to have none to move, ſtir, or draw in him to the will of God, or the knowledge of Gods will, to be good, or to will Gods will to be done. God moved and ſtirred up himſelf to ſtrive, move, or draw man to do his declared will, and to bring mans will into his will, and to cauſe mans will to be reſigned up into Gods will; and ſo the Tempter perſwaded man that he ſhould be as God, and not as a Creature, but of himſelf, as a God, to ſtir, move, and draw his will to do Gods declared will, and to bring his will into Gods will, and to cauſe it to be reſigned up into Gods will. And thus man was, by the perſwadings of the Tempter, drawn into a belief to know good abſolute in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as God knew good in himſelf.</p>
            <p>And man by the temptation was perſwaded that he ſhould know evil, as God knew evil. God knew that the doing of what he had forbidden, was evil; and ſo man knew evil: God had made it known to man to be evil, the doing of what he had forbidden him to do; but in mans doing of what God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden man to do, man came to a greater meaſure of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for he came to know evil in the act, in the not doing Gods will, but in doing of his own will: And ſo the Tempter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded man he ſhould be as God, and not as a creature, to do the will of another; but as God, to do his own will as God did his will. And God knew that it was evil, becauſe he had forbidden it, and ſo man knew it to be evil. God had made known to man, that what he had forbidden him to do, was an evil, and the evil was, in that it was forbidden of God: And God had that knowledge of himſelf, that what he had forbidden was evil, and that which made it evil was, becauſe God had forbidden it. And ſo the Tempter perſwaded man that he ſhould have that knowledge of himſelf as God had of himſelf, to know that what God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, was evil, and the evil was, becauſe God had forbidden it.</p>
            <p>And if man could be true to himſelf, and to the Light of God in him, he might by experience ſee the Tempter now to be in man in the fallen ſtate, acting all this in him; and thereby he might come to ſee how the Tempter acted it in man, to draw him at firſt into the fallen ſtate, where all men now in that fallen ſtate are in ſome meaſure, degree, or other ſo tempted. God had none to make known his declared will to him, but he knew it of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152785:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> himſelf. How does the Tempter now tempt man in that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and knowledge that he hath of God, to have ſuch high thoughts of himſelf, that he need not depend upon another to be taught to know what is Gods will, but he hath ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf, as that he may know that of himſelf? And as God willed his will of himſelf, ſo the Tempter now perſwades man that he may will Gods will of himſelf: And as God of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf willed his will to be done, ſo the Tempter now perſwades man that he may of himſelf will Gods will to be done: And as God had none but himſelf that moved him to his will, or to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will to be good, or to have his will done; ſo the Tempter now perſwades man that he need none but himſelf to move him to do Gods will, and that of himſelf he can reſigne up his will into Gods will: And ſo as to the knowledge of evil which God by his Light in man makes known to him to be his doing of what God hath forbidden him to do, and the evil is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath forbidden it to be done; and the Tempter now perſwades man that he may have this knowledge of himſelf, that of himſelf he may know the evil that God hath forbidden to be done, and that of himſelf he knows it to be evil, becauſe God hath forbidden it.</p>
            <p>How is the truth of this manifeſted, that many by the ſubtilty of the temptations of the Serpent, have ſuch high thoughts, that of himſelf, in that underſtanding and knowledge that he hath of God, he knows Gods will, and can will as God will, and can do Gods will? And this appeareth by the outward actions of many that take no notice of it, how it is acted within them. How do many, when they have been a drinking until they are near drunk, or a ſwearing and curſing very highly, or in a great paſſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger threatning revenge upon thoſe they are offended with, or in deceiving, wronging of their Neighbours, or in uncleanneſs, or in the doing of ſome other ſins whatſoever; and yet-preſently lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by or leaving off but the outward action of ſin, and that while the delight and love to the ſin is in their hearts and minds, and they acting of the ſin within them; and yet in this condition they ſtep out of the outward acting of ſin, and while it is ſtill in the action within them, and they go preſently into what they call their Prayers to God and their Worſhip and Service of God? I pray conſider and ſee what it is that ſtrive, move, or draw them thus to their Prayers, Worſhip, and Service of God, as they call it;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152785:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> is it not the ſubtile Serpent tempting in them, and perſwading them that the eyes of their underſtanding and knowledge being opened, they are as Gods to themſelves in the knowing good and evil? Evil they know, they know the ſins they commit to be evil, and that they are evil, becauſe God hath forbidden the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. And good they know, they know that there is a God, and that this God is good, and that this God is to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, and to be worſhipped and ſerved; and to pray to this God, to worſhip and ſerve God, they know to be good. And their wills in this knowledge, that ſets them upon what they call Prayers, Worſhip, and Service to God.</p>
            <p>And how do they pray? They do not pray as the Apoſtle ſaid of himſelf and the Saints, <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought: but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which cannot be uttered,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. And Jeſus ſaid, <hi>God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit, and in truth,</hi> John. 4. 24. But they do not wait in the ſilence of all the earthy part in them, to find in them the ſtrivings, movings, or drawings of the Spirit of God in them, to lead them forth to Prayer, to the Worſhip and Service of God: No, they do not wait for Gods Spirit to ſtir, move, or draw in them, to pray to God, or to worſhip and ſerve God in ſpirit and in truth. But they put themſelves forth into the doing thereof, they having eaten of the forbidden Tree, they having done that which they knew God had commanded them not to do. And the eyes of their underſtanding and knowledge being opened, they ſee themſelves naked, that is, that they have ſinned againſt God, and that there is judgment due to them from this God that they have offended, and that makes them afraid, and to paſſifie the apprehenſions that they have in them of the anger of this God, which by that underſtanding and knowledge that they have of him, they know to be due to them for their ſins. And by that underſtanding and knowledge that they have of God, they know that he is good, and that it is good to pray to him, and to worſhip and ſerve him. And the ſubtile Serpent that by his temptations drew them in to eat of the forbidden Tree, the doing of what God had forbidden them to do; he perſwades them that their eyes being opened by that underſtanding and knowledge that they have of God, they of themſelves know what is Gods declared will that they ſhould do, in praying to him, in worſhipping and ſerving of him; and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152785:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they of themſelves can will Gods will to be done; and they of themſelves can bring up their wills to do Gods will, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their Prayers, Worſhip, and Service to God. And thus the ſubtile Serpent perſwades them that their eyes being opened, they are as Gods, to know, will, and to do all of themſelves; and ſo of themſelves they pray, worſhip, and ſerve God, as they call it: and are not contented to be as Creatures, to know nothing, but as they wait upon God to reveal it in them by his Spirit; and to will nothing, but what God in his will willeth in them; and to do nothing, but what God by his Spirit led or draw them forth in the doing thereof. Although few are ſo bold or ignorant of God, as to confeſs with their tongues that they of themſelves do know Gods declared will that it is good, and that they of themſelves can will Gods will to be done in them, and that they of themſelves can bring up their wills to do Gods will in praying to him, and in worſhipping and ſerving of him; yet by their actions they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the truth of what with their tongues they will not confeſs: for by their actions it doth appear, that they do all, as Gods, of themſelves, in that they do not wait upon God for him to do it in them by the leadings or drawings of his Spirit in them; but they yield to the ſtirrings, movings, or drawings of their own wills: and as their wills lead them out for to do, ſo they go forth in their Prayer, Worſhip, and Service to God, as they call it.</p>
            <p>It were well, if all thoſe that are in the uſe of Set Forms of Prayers, and thoſe that pray in their Families at ſet times, would conſider what is the leading, ſtirring, moving, or drawing Cauſe of their ſo praying; and to ſee whether or no they do pray as the Apoſtle ſaid of himſelf and the Saints, That they knew not what they ſhould pray for as they ought; but as the Spirit it ſelf made interceſſion for them, with groanings that cannot be uttered: and that their Prayers be performed in Gods Spirit and in truth, or elſe they are not acceptable to God who is a Spirit. I ſo well love all of them whoſe Lives and Converſations, as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, are blameleſs, and uſe thoſe Prayers as a Sacrifice or Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to God, as to beg of them to have a care that in the uſe of them the Serpent do not deceive them, as he hath deceived me in praying, worſhipping, and ſerving of God: For by experience I do know, that what is done in praying, worſhipping, and ſerving of God, that is not done wholly and alone by the Spirit of God in man; and man in the doing thereof, to be but an Inſtrument in Gods
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152785:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> hand to do his work by. And ſo indeed and in truth, it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but God the Son in us, praying, worſhipping, and ſerving God the Father, that hath begotten us in himſelf again unto a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead: And what Prayer, Worſhip, and Service is not thus done in God unto God, is not acceptable to God; and all other Prayers, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Service that hath been done in me, and called by me Prayer, Worſhip, and Service done to God, I do now know and have experienced it to be true, that it hath onely been done by the ſubtilty of the Serpent in me, in that underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I had of God, that cauſed me to have high thoughts of my ſelf; and that of my ſelf, in that underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I had of God, I could pray, worſhip, and ſerve God, and was as God to my ſelf, that is, to will what I knew was Gods will, and to do what I knew to be Gods will that I ſhould do, that is, as to an outward obedience to God. And now I do know, that all that then I did in obedience to God, was done in my own will, and for my own ſelf-ends. And knowing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that I was then in, being in the womans deceived ſtate, and ſo in the tranſgreſſion, and ſo in danger of periſhing, I cannot but out of love and pity to thoſe that are in that ſtate, give them warning for them to have a care that they do not fall into that Quick-ſand that lieth ſo hid in man; and as an honeſt Traveller in the outward Land, having fallen into a Quick-ſand, ſetteth a mark there, that ſo others may have a care of falling into the ſame place: This being the end of all my making known of what I know of the ſubtil Serpents ſelf-will in me.</p>
            <p>And further, to make it more clearer that it is the work of the Tempter in man, as man is in the fallen ſtate, to perſwade man to have high thoughts, that of himſelf, in that underſtanding and knowledge that he hath of God; he can know Gods will, and can will Gods will, and can do what God would have him to do. And if this be not the true ſtate of man in the fall, to have the ſubtile Serpent to be thus in him tempting of him, I deſire then to know from whence it comes, that many now ſee it to be ſo hard for man to become a very nothing in the Work of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſo God may be all in it, and man nothing but onely as God makes him an Inſtrument in his hand. But they who are not in ſome meaſure come to the knowledge of that in them, as to know how hard a thing it is to become a nothing in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152785:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> working out of their ſalvation, that ſo God may be all in them in that great work of ſaving of them; to them it is as hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth of what I have ſaid (concerning the experience that ſome have ſeen of the Tempter, how he now tempts in man, and therefore they cannot believe how the Tempter firſt tempted in man, and cauſe him to fall) it is as hard for ſuch to believe it, as it is for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle: They are of the number of thoſe rich men that have not ſold all, that hath not parted with all, and are become ſo poor as to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to be nothing, to will nothing, that ſo they may enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but they are of the number that do ſtill ſee themſelves to be as Gods, that is, to have of their own, to be of their own, to do of their own, to will of their own: and are not yet come into that ſtate of being become new Creatures, they are not come into that ſtate that God at firſt made all things, of nothing; nothing was before the Creation, and nothing man muſt be of himſelf, before God doth his great work of creating man his new Creature.</p>

               <hi>And when the woman ſaw the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eye, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, ſhe took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave alſo unto her husband with her, and he did eat.</hi> I pray obſerve the words of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: <hi>And when the woman ſaw that the tree was good for food,</hi> at that very inſtant of time that ſhe ſaw the Tree was good for food, at that very inſtant of time <hi>it was pleaſant to the eye;</hi> and at that very time it was <hi>a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe;</hi> at that very inſtant of time <hi>ſhe took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave alſo unto her husband with her, and he did eat.</hi> Here was not a ſeeing of the Tree to be good for food, at one time; and then at a time after, that it was pleaſant to the eye; and then at a time after, that it was a Tree to be deſired to make one wiſe; and then at a time after, that ſhe took of the Fruit thereof and did eat, and gave alſo to her Husband with her, and he did eat. No, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not ſpeak after that manner; but the Scripture ſaith, <hi>And when the woman ſaw the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eye, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe.</hi> All theſe are joyned and linked together, as to the matter of time, to be at once in the woman; when was the one, then was the other of them, they are not ſeparated; and as they are not ſeparated the one from the other, as to the matter of time
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152785:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> wherein they were done, but all joyned and linked together; ſo is not her taking of the Fruit thereof and eating of it, and giving of it to her Husband with her, and he did eat. Theſe are all joyned and linked together, as to the matter of time wherein they were done: <hi>when the woman ſaw that the tree was good for food, and pleaſant to the eye, and to be deſired to make one wiſe,</hi> at the very ſame inſtant of time <hi>ſhe took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave alſo to her husband with her, and he did eat.</hi> The time when joyns them altogether to be done when the one was done, then at that inſtant of time the other was done, ſo joyned and linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as to the matter of time when they were done, as not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the one from the other.</p>
            <p>When the woman in the underſtanding and knowledge that ſhe had, ſaw a good in the Tree, and ſuch a good as that it was good for food; for to that the Serpent in his temptation in time had brought her unto: whereas in the beginning of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the underſtanding and knowledge that ſhe had, ſhe ſaw the Tree not to be good for food, nor yet the Fruit of it to be eaten; but inſtead of being good for food, ſhe ſaw the eating of the Fruit thereof, if I may ſo call it, of a poyſonous nature, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death, becauſe God had ſaid, that in the day they eat thereof, they ſhould ſurely die. But the Serpents temptation continuing in her, at length it prevailed ſo far in her, to bring her to make a wrong uſe of that underſtanding and knowledge that God had given to her: For the end of Gods giving man that portion of underſtanding and knowledge, it was; that man ſhould improve this his portion of knowledge in doing Gods will, in yielding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God. But man miſ-ſpent his portion, and made uſe of it in diſobeying God, and goes out of the doing Gods will, into the doing his own will; the temptation having firſt prevailed in man to queſtion the truth of what God had ſaid, that they ſhould ſurely die in the day they eat of the forbidden fruit. And then when the temptation had prevailed in man ſo far as to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the lye, that the ſubtile Serpent ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die. For God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened: and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation having thus prevailed in the woman, this cauſed her, in that underſtanding and knowledge that ſhe then had (after the temptation had ſo far prevailed in her and over her) to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tree to be good, and not onely to be good, but to be good
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152785:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> for food; that which before, when the temptation firſt entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her by the underſtanding and knowledge that ſhe then had, ſhe ſaw to be evil for food, and of (if I may ſo ſay) a dangerous and poyſonous nature, bringing Death along with the eating of it, and ſo ſhe did not then yield to the Temptation; but when the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation had prevailed in her and over her, then it was that in that underſtanding and knowledge that ſhe then had, ſhe ſaw the tree (that once ſhe ſaw to be evil to eat of) to be good, and not onely good, but good for food; the good ſhe then ſaw in it, was in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what God had forbidden: God had not forbidden the being of the Tree. The tree of Life was in the midſt of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil, ſo that the tree in it ſelf was not evil; the evil was in the eating of it, the eating of it was that which God had forbidden, and the temptation having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the woman to queſtion the truth of what God had ſaid, and to give credit to the lye that the Serpent had ſaid; and when the Serpent by his temptation had prevailed thus far in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, then he cauſed her in that underſtanding and knowledge that ſhe then had, to ſee a good in what God had forbidden, which in it ſelf was evil; and the good that ſhe ſaw, was a good for food, and therefore to be eaten. Good food eaten by the outward bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as inſtrumental, it hath this in it, that is, it contents and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies the hunger or deſire of the body, it refreſhes, comforts, and ſtrengthens the body, and it preſerves the life of the body; and thus did the woman in that underſtanding and knowledge that then ſhe had, look upon the tree to be good for food, and ſo it was pleaſant to the eye, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe; ſhe ſo ſaw it to be good for food, that in the eating of the fruit thereof, ſhe ſhould be contented and ſatisfied in the enjoying of it, that is, in the eating of it her deſire, her hunger after it, would be ſatisfied; and to ſpeak after the manner of outward eating, ſhe in the eating thereof ſhould be ſo refreſhed, comforted, and ſtrengthened, as to be no more wiſe as a Creature, (for ſo ſhe was before the temptation entred into her, ſhe was wiſe as God had made her wiſe) but to be thereby made wiſe, which was another being made wiſe, than that being wiſe as God had made her; it was to be made wiſe as gods, and to live in the being as gods in knowledge, knowing good and evil, as God knew good and evil: this was that which cauſed the tree to be deſired and hungred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was to make one wiſe; which making wiſe, muſt be that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152785:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> being wiſe that the Tempter tempted to; that was, in the day they eat thereof, then their eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be as gods, knowing good and evil; this was that in the tree that was deſired and hungred after; and the expectation of content and ſatisfaction in the eating thereof, was in that to be as gods, to be wiſe as gods, knowing good and evil, and thereby to be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, comforted, and ſtrengthened, as to live as gods knowing of good and evil.</p>
            <p>And thus man miſ-ſpent and made a bad uſe of that portion of underſtanding and knowledge that God had given to him, in which he as he knew Gods will, ſo he was to obey God in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods will. But inſtead of keeping in his obedience in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he knew to be Gods will, there was ſomething in him that cauſed him firſt to queſtion, whether what he once knew and believed to be Gods will, whether it was Gods will or no? and having prevailed therein with man, then the Tempter cauſed man to ſee a good, in what man once ſaw to be an evil; that was, to eat of the forbidden Fruit: and in that man once ſaw ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to be in it, as to be the cauſe of death, if he took and eat thereof. Now the Tempter cauſed man to ſee ſuch a good to be in it, that if he took and eat of it, he ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil; and when man ſaw this, at that very inſtant of time the deſire of the mind was to the enjoying of it, and at the ſame inſtant of time he took and eat of it; and then man made his full manifeſtation and appearance of his going out of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in doing Gods will, into his diſobedience of doing his own will: And although then when man took and eat there was the full diſcovery of mans will in the Temptation, yet there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of mans will that was in the beginning of the Temptation, although then it lay hid. The ſubſtance of mans eating of the fruit of the forbidden Tree, conſiſts in this, That man went out of his obedience to God, which he was once in, and ſo was in the doing of Gods will, and went into the diſobedience in the doing of his own will, which man knew nothing of any will of his own, before the temptation entered into him; that is, he knew nothing of any will in him contrary to the will of God in him.</p>
            <p>Some queſtion there may be, which was firſt in man to draw man into diſobedience, Pride, or Will? they are ſo nearly joyned and united together, as it is hard to diſcern which of them was firſt: But I believe Will was firſt in man, although Pride made
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152785:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> his firſt appearance to be there. Man in that great underſtanding and knowledge that he had of God, was therewith lifted up with Pride, which cauſed a deſire in him to be as Gods: But what was that which ſo lifted man up? was it not his Will, in that he would be as Gods? And this Will wrought in the earthy part in man, as the Mole doth in the ground hidden and not diſcerned; the earth that the Mole raiſeth up, is firſt ſeen, before the Mole that is the cauſe of raiſing it up, ſo it was in the Temptation; Pride did firſt appear, before the Will that raiſed up the Pride: for was it not Pride in man to be ſo bold to ask a queſtion, thereby to queſtion the truth of what God had ſaid? Thus Pride firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Temptation, that which would ſeem to have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality with God, in that it would undertake to queſtion God in the truth of his Word; and this was Pride that which was ſo lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up with that great underſtanding and knowledge that it had of God, was Pride; and it was by the underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part in man that that queſtion was asked, it was by that which knew that God had ſpoken to man, and knew that man was to eat of the trees of the garden, and by this knowledge it was that Pride asked the queſtion, yea, hath God ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall not eat of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tree of the garden?</hi> And what was that, that thus lifted up man? was it not his Will, wherein he deſired to be as Gods? but this Will was not ſo ſtrong at firſt, as to prevail with man to go out of Gods will; there was a greater appearance at firſt of Pride, in queſtioning the truth of what God had ſaid, than there was an appearance of Will to be as gods: And in this the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the Tempter, <hi>was more ſubtile than any beaſt of the field which the Lord God had made,</hi> for man having the enjoyment and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all them, they never lifted up the heart of man into pride, nor did they cauſe in man a will or deſire to be as gods.</p>
            <p>When God had made man, the tree of Life was in the midſt of the garden (in the midſt of mans heart, or the inward part of man) which was Jeſus in man keeping man in obedience to God. As long as man obeyed God, he lived in God, and God lived in him, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil both trees were in the midſt of the garden, and were not forbidden to be there; that which was forbidden, was the eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The eating of the fruit of it was forbidden, and not onely to be eaten, but not to be touched; and that is the great
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152785:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> myſtery of the Creation of man, which God in his time will make known in man and to man his Creature, that both trees were in man, as made in his Image. To be tempted is no ſin, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; that which is forbidden, is to yield to the temptation, that is, ſin. To eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, or the fruit of it, or to touch the fruit of it, this was what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Jeſus was tempted, but he did not yield to the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo did not ſin; <hi>Jeſus was led up of the ſpirit into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to be tempted of the devil,</hi> Mat. 4. 1. mark that <hi>led of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil,</hi> read it within who can in the myſtery, there is ſo much in it, and ſo much do I ſee in it, that if I ſhould declare it, few at this day could bear it; Jeſus told his Diſciples, <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now,</hi> John 16. 12.</p>
            <p>I hope I may, without offence to any, write what is in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: And firſt as to the time when <hi>Jeſus was led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil,</hi> Matth. 4. 1. which is not by every one that reads it minded, or any notice taken of it, although there is very much in it. The time it was then, when at that very time that Jeſus had by his Fore-runner <hi>John,</hi> fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and had the Spirit of God deſcending like a dove, and lighted upon him, <hi>and lo, a voice from Heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Matth. 3. 15, 16, 17. then was the time, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 12. immediately it was that then was <hi>Jeſus led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil.</hi> Secondly, it was Jeſus, it was the beloved Son of God, in whom he was well pleaſed, that had fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, it was he that came to ſave his people from their ſins, that <hi>was led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil;</hi> the Scripture does not ſay that he went of himſelf into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be tempted of the Devil; <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith of it, <hi>Mark 1. 12. the ſpirit driveth him into the wilderneſs.</hi> Thirdly, it was the ſpirit that led up the beloved Son of God, in whom he was well pleaſed, that had fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, that came to ſave his people from their ſins, <hi>into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil;</hi> it was no man nor any outward earthy Creature, that led up Jeſus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil, but <hi>Jeſus was led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil;</hi> there is much in that, I pray mark the words of the Scripture, it is not ſaid, that Jeſus was led down of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs to be tempted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152785:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Devil, but <hi>Jeſus was led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil.</hi> Fourthly, this beloved Son of God, in whom God was well pleaſed, that had fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, that came to ſave his people from their ſins, whither was he led up of the ſpirit to be tempted of the Devil? it was into the wilderneſs; not onely led up to a wilderneſs, which might be to the outſide of a wilderneſs, but led up into the wilderneſs; he was led up into the wilderneſs, he was in the wilderneſs: what wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdeſs? the wilderneſs is all the name that is given to it in the Scriptures; outward wilderneſs have outward names. There is a wilderneſs that is not without, nor hath an outward name, and yet it is a wilderneſs, and may truly be ſaid to be the wilderneſs. Fifthly, and this beloved Son of God, in whom he was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that had fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, that came to ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſins, was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil, as firſt being there in the wilderneſs, and in want he was then tempted by the Devil, to do that which God had not commanded him to do to ſupply his want, being an hungred, he was tempted to command thoſe ſtones to be made bread. Secondly, he being taken up (mark that taken up) of the Devil into the holy City, and ſet upon a pinacle of the Temple, he was tempted of the Devil, to preſume upon God: the Fathers love and care, becauſe God had given his Angels charge concerning him, to preſerve him from harm, therefore he was tempted to caſt himſelf down from a pinacle of the Temple. Thirdly, he was taken up (mark that taken up) by the Devil into an exceeding high mountain, and ſhewed all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them, and tempted by the Devil, to do that which was altogether unlawful, to have given to him the things of the World, the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them, and that was, to fall down and worſhip the Devil: And in theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations in the wilderneſs that he was of the ſpirit led up into, he did make it appear, that he was the Son of God, by his obedience to God, as is plain by his not yielding in the leaſt to any of the Temptations. Sixthly, this beloved Son of God, in whom God was well pleaſed, that had fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, that came to ſave his people from their ſins, he was led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil, to be tempted of him that was a murderer from the beginning, to be tempted of him that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not in the truth, to be tempted of him that there is no
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152785:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> truth in him, to be tempted of him that is a lyar and the father of lyes, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. I pray take notice of this, that the Scripture doth not ſay, that Jeſus was led up of the ſpirit to be tempted of the Devil, any where, but onely in the wilderneſs; and when he had faſted forty days and forty nights, he was afterwards an hungred (mark that <hi>an hungred,</hi> he wanted bread, there is much in that of Jeſus being an hungred) and when the Tempter came to him, he ſaid the Tempter ſaid, that which tempted him, it was that which ſaid, which being taken notice of; it may as an inſtrument in Gods hand, be as an help to underſtand what the wilderneſs was, and what the Devil was, and what Jeſus temptations were that he was tempted in; the holy City, and the Temple, they were not in an outward wilderneſs; and where is there an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mountain in the outward world ſo exceedingly high, that upon it may be ſeen all the outward Kingdoms of the outward World, and the outward glory of them? and Jeſus in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation was taken up into an exceeding high mountain, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them, if the Reader who underſtandeth little or nothing of the myſtery of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus being led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil, did but in true ſilence of all the earthy part in him, of all that is of the fleſh in him, wait upon God, and be like the poor Widow to the unjuſt Judge, who would not give over going to him, until he had done her juſtice; ſo, not to give over waiting upon God, in true ſelf-denial, in being as a nothing in thy ſelf, until God ſend his ſpirit, that quiet into all truth, to guide, to ſearch, to let thee underſtand ſomething of the great myſtery that is in theſe few words, <hi>Then was Jeſus led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil,</hi> thou wouldſt then find that thoſe few words have been much read without, and very little underſtood by the outward Readers within, they have read little of them within themſelves.</p>
            <p>The forbidden fruit, as it was preſented in the temptation, it was pleaſant to the eye, and to be deſired to make wiſe; the knowing of Gods will, and not to do Gods will, is the forbidden fruit: What God requires of man to obey him in, and what man knows to be Gods will that he ſhould obey him in, is good; but to know Gods will, and not to do it is evil, that is the knowing of good and evil in the action, which is ſin. To know, is very pleaſant to the eye, becauſe it makes wiſe; and how much is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152785:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> there a deſire in man going forth after knowledge, that they may be wiſe, becauſe Wiſdom is one part of the Eſſence or Being of God, and it is to be like God; and ſo man in the temptation had a deſire to be like God, as being wiſe. And thus man deſired to know more of God, than he deſired in that knowledge to yield obedience to God in what he knew of God. And this is the forbidden fruit, to have a deſire to be wiſe like God, to know God, or the mind and will of God, and not to obey God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he knew to be Gods will; this was <hi>Adams</hi> fall, this was the forbidden fruit which man was not to eat of, nor yet to touch it. And now man is fallen, who can ſay upon a true exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of himſelf in the inward parts, that he is now judged or condemned for the doing of any thing, but for the doing of thoſe things that God hath made known to him that he ought not to do, or elſe he is judged and condemned for the not doing of thoſe things that God hath made known to him to be his will that he ought to do, and ſhould do; the condemnation is either for doing what we know we ought not to do, or for leaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done what we know that we ſhould do.</p>
            <p>The woman myſtically being the figure of mans being drawn by the ſpirit, or the goings or leadings forth of man by the ſpirit of Jeſus in man; for as the Lord God took the woman out of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo is mans being drawn by the ſpirit, or the goings or leadings forth of man by the ſpirit of Jeſus in man, is the work of the Lord God; and they are given as Help-meets for the life of Jeſus in man; that is, as Help-meets for that life of Jeſus in man that is in him, ſaving of him from ſin. And as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as ſhe was taken out of <hi>Adam,</hi> although ſhe was bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, yet ſhe had a diſtinct and ſeparated body from <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo in the myſtery is to be underſtood mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn by the ſpirit of Jeſus, or the goings or leadings forth of the ſpirit of Jeſus in man, although taken out of Jeſus in man (as the woman was taken out of man) to be diſtinct and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Jeſus in man, and ſerve for the end the woman was created for, to be as an Help-meet for man, ſo man by theſe draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſpirit, or the goings or leadings forth of man by the ſpirit of Jeſus in man, are as Help-meets for the life of Jeſus in man.</p>
            <p>How is the life of Jeſus in man refreſhed and comforted, when there is in man a drawing, going, or leading forth of the ſpirit to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152785:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> meditate of Gods goodneſs, or to meditate of ſome myſtery that God is making known to the Soul, either what God is, or what he hath made man to be, or what man was before the fall, or what man made himſelf by the fall, or what God hath made man by his redeeming of him, or what man ſhall be in the reſurrection; or ſometimes in praying or ſpeaking, or ſome ſudden Viſion, or breakings out of the manifeſtations of Gods love in theſe or other of the drawings, leadings, or goings forth of man by the Spirit of Jeſus in man! How is the Life of Jeſus in man helped and refreſhed? that is, that Life of Jeſus in man that is in him ſaving of him from ſin. So as the woman was created to be an Help-meet for <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo hath God made man by theſe drawings, leadings, or goings forth of man by the Spirit of Jeſus in man, as Help-meets for the Life of Jeſus in man, as he is in man a ſaving him from ſin. Now, as I ſaid before, as the woman, although taken out of <hi>Adam,</hi> and was bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, yet ſhe had a diſtinct and ſeparate body of her ſelf. So in the myſtery, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though man by theſe drawings of the Spirit, or goings or leadings forth of man by the Spirit, they come from Jeſus, and are taken out of Jeſus in man; yet in the myſtery they are to be looked upon as a diſtinct and ſeparate body from Jeſus in man, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was a diſtinct and ſeparate body from man.</p>
            <p>Now the Serpents ſelf, or a mans own will, as ſeparated from God, as it is in the fall, and ſo is become a fallen Angel or Spirit, and being in the garden of God, that is, in the heart or inward part of man, this preſents to the woman (that is, to man, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn of the Spirit, or his goings, or being led forth by the Spirit of Jeſus in man) a deſire more to know the things of God, than to come into the obedience of what God hath by thoſe drawings, leadings, or goings forth of the Spirit, made known to them to obey him in, (and this is the forbidden Fruit) for man to deſire to know more of God in thoſe manifeſtations or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he hath received from God by the drawings, leadings, or goings forth of his Spirit in them, than to obey God in what he knew of God, or that God doth make known to him of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thoſe manifeſtations or enjoyments that he gives of himſelf unto man. And this deſire after knowledge, this Serpents ſelf or a mans own will in the fall, preſents to be very pleaſant to the eye of the woman, and to be deſired to be made wiſe, and by it to be as Gods.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:152785:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But theſe preſentations to the woman, is to be taken as if man in theſe drawings, goings, or leadings forth of the Spirit, were diſtinct and ſeparate from Jeſus, as the woman was from the man. And that is onely to be taken as to that ſenſe or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Soul (wherein theſe drawings or goings forth of the Spirit are acted) hath of them, that is, as the Soul or inward part of man does look upon the drawings, goings, or leadings forth of the Spirit of Jeſus in them, and take them in as their own drawings, goings, or leadings forth after God; and do not look upon them as they are the work of God or Jeſus in them. And thus, as at a diſtance or ſeparate from Jeſus, that is, the Soul firſt loſing the being ſenſible of its being drawn, going, or being led forth by the Spirit of Jeſus in them, to be the work of Jeſus in them, and ſo not keeping in the low and meek Spirit, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up with what they enjoy of God in thoſe drawings, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or leadings forth of the Spirit in them, ſelf or mans will in the fall, prevails through the pleaſing part that it hath of thoſe drawings, goings, or leadings forth of the Spirit, as to look upon them as their own, and they do not look upon them as the work of Jeſus in them: And from this a deſire gets up in man to be wiſe. And ſo that in man (which is the woman) that was drawn, led, or went forth by the Spirit, takes and eats of them; that is, to take it down into them, and ſatisfie themſelves therewith as their own drawings, leadings, or goings forth after God; which they were drawn, led, or went forth to, by the Spirit of Jeſus in them: Not that the drawings, goings, or leadings forth of the Spirit of Jeſus in man, can eat of the forbidden Fruit, they cannot eat of the forbidden Fruit; but man in thoſe drawings, goings, or leadings forth of the Spirit, eats of the forbidden Fruit, that is, he takes down into himſelf, as man does the food he eats, a deſire more to know of God than to obey God in what he knows: And ſo as mans body is ſatisfied with taking in and eating of his food, ſo man ſatisfies himſelf with taking and eating of knowledge, and contents himſelf with knowledge, as with food, to live upon, and his life is in it.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon why man takes in, eats, and feeds himſelf upon knowledge in the drawings, leadings, or goings forth of Jeſus's Spirit in him, is, becauſe of mans not minding or having regard to the root from whence thoſe drawings, goings, or leadings forth of the Spirit in him, ſprung; which is from Jeſus in them; but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152785:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> they looking upon them as their own, and as ſpringing or coming from ſomething of their own: And here the ſubtile Serpents ſelf, or mans own will, as it is ſeparated from Gods will, gets in his head; and having got in his head, he by degrees rigles in his whole body. He at firſt began ſo with the woman; he firſt ſaid to her, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?</hi> He puts it by way of queſtion (and cauſes her to queſtion) whether it were true or no, that God had ſaid, that they ſhould not eat of every tree of the garden. And when Jeſus the Light (that lightneth every man that cometh into the world) tells the woman what was Gods Command, and the Will of God that they ſhould do; and the puniſhment, if they tranſgreſſed Gods Command, that is they ſhould die: it was Jeſus in the woman that gave the Serpent this anſwer; it was that in the woman, that if ſhe would have believed and obeyed, would have kept her from ſinning, from eating the forbidden fruit. But the Serpent, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got in his head into her, in cauſing her to queſtion the truth of Gods Command, whether or no God had ſaid, they ſhould not eat of every tree of the garden. Now he rigleth in his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and by his lying would make God a lyar, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die. For God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened: and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> Here the Serpent gets in his body rigling it in a little at once. Firſt, he removes the penalty out of the womans thoughts, perſwading her ſhe ſhall not die, as God had ſaid; and ſo gives God the lye, or makes God a lyar: And when the Serpent had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the woman that God had not ſaid true, then he eaſily wrought in her a good opinion of himſelf, that he ſpake true when he told her (the lye) that God knew that in the day ſhe eat of the forbidden Fruit, their eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be as Gods, knowing good and evil: they ſhould not onely be as Gods, but their eyes ſhould be opened ſo as that they ſhould ſee themſelves as Gods.</p>
            <p>How doth experience at this day teach the truth of this? That before the Devil doth prevail with them to yield to his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he firſt begets a doubt or queſtion in the heart, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God hath forbidden the doing of what the Devil tempteth to do; that is, as the Devil preſents his falſe gloſs upon it, that there is a good to be gained by yielding to his temptations; as he did the forbidden fruit to the woman, that it was good for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152785:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> food, and to be deſired to make wiſe. And if the Devil once prevail ſo far as to get the Creature to reaſon the caſe with him, whether the doing of what he tempteth, to be lawful or not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſo makes the perſon doubtful and queſtioning in what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew and believed to be the will of God, and obeyed God in, (as was the caſe of the woman, ſhe knew and believed ſhe was not to eat of the forbidden fruit, and for a time obeyed God in it) then he ſoon prevails with them (as he did with the woman) to hopes of eſcaping the penalty that Jeſus, the Light in them, hath told them would follow upon their breaking Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and then how eaſily is the Creature carried away to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of what the Devil ſaid to be true (as did the woman) that by yielding to his temptations, they ſhall be great gainers! (the woman was promiſed to have her eyes opened, and to be as Gods, knowing good and evil.) What greater gain can any have by yielding to the Devils temptations, than to have their eyes opened, and to be as Gods? And who is it that can ſay, if ever they did take any notice or regard how the Devil tempts them, and how they have been carried away with his temptations, if they have not in ſome degree or meaſure found it to be ſo, That firſt there is a queſtion or doubt in them, whether what they are tempted to, be a breaking of the Command of God; or if it be a breaking of the Command of God, yet not ſo great a breaking of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, as that they ſhall ſurely die for it, that is, be ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damned for it; but they may eat of the forbidden fruit, and yet be as Gods, that is, break Gods Command, and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, and have their own minds, wills, and deſires ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in what they do? And what can be greater gain than this, to have their minds and wills? This to them is a Kingdom; and herein they think themſelves like Gods, they are as Gods to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for as God made all things for himſelf to be glorified in them, ſo as much as in them lieth, they make all things their own to ſatisfie and pleaſe themſelves in them; and yet pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a hope that God will forgive them all their ſins, and that they ſhall be like God at laſt.</p>
            <p>And thus when the Serpent had prevailed in his temptations with the woman, that they ſhould not ſurely die, but that their eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be as Gods, knowing good and evil, and that the woman ſaw the Tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eye, and a Tree to be deſired to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152785:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> make one wiſe, <hi>then ſhe took of the fruit thereof, and did eat.</hi> The fruit of the Tree was wilful diſobedience; ſhe eat, ſhe ſatisfied her ſelf with a deſire after the knowledge of good, and willingly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected her obedience to God; ſhe knew Gods mind and will what ſhe ſhould do, but did not obey God in that ſhe knew to be Gods will that ſhe ought to obey him in; but inſtead of yielding obedience to God in what ſhe knew of God, the Serpent telling her that their eyes ſhould be opened, that was, to ſee more or better than they did ſee, as much in difference as is between ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the eyes as if they were ſhut, and the ſeeing with them wide open. And this muſt be underſtood as to the underſtanding and knowing part in man: for none can be ſo ignorant as to think that the eyes of their bodies were not open before the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, but it is the eye of the underſtanding and knowledge that was to be opened by yielding to the temptation, to know more of God than they did know of him. And by this the woman was carried out to a deſire of another knowledge of God, and likewiſe to God, than that knowledge of God that God had given to them in the Creation; and another likeneſs of God, than that Image of God that he had made them in: And by this running out after a deſire of a greater meaſure of the knowledge of God and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, and not to obey God in what they knew to be his will to obey him in. Here diſobedience, that got in (the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit that was eaten they eat, that is, they filled and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themſelves with a deſire of knowledge, as a man eats and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies himſelf with meat, and did not yield obedience to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they knew of God,) and ſo that knowledge of God and likeneſs to God that they were made in. And as they were created, ſo they for a time had obeyed God in that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in that likeneſs that they were created in, until the time of their diſobedience; and then by their eating of the forbidden fruit, their obedience died in them: And ſo man died in the day he eat of the forbidden fruit, he died in his obedience to God, his obedience to God died in him; he died as to that knowledge that he had of God, as being in Gods Image, the Image of God that he was made in, was dead in him; mans body did not die in the day he eat the forbidden fruit, nor was mans body that Image of God that he made man in.</p>
            <p>Before mans fall, all that he did was done by his being drawn, lead, or going forth by the Spirit of Jeſus in him; he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152785:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> but God, and the doing Gods will; and to that ſtate man is again to be reſtored. 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 45, 47, 49. The firſt Adam was made a living ſoul,</hi> (this was not the body of <hi>Adam</hi> that God made of the duſt of the ground, but it was that which after he had made that body, then God breathed into that body the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul which was this firſt <hi>Adam) the laſt Adam was made a quickning ſpirit. The firſt man is of the earth, earthy: the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven. As we have born the Image of the earthy, we ſhall alſo have the Image of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</hi> Here the Apoſtle giveth the deſcription of the two <hi>Adams,</hi> and what they were made; <hi>the firſt a living ſoul, the ſecond a quickning ſpirit:</hi> And then what they were; <hi>the firſt man is of the earth, the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven:</hi> And then he deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth how he and the Saints were in likeneſs to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſhall be in likeneſs to the laſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and to the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man: <hi>And as we have born the Image of the earthy, we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bear the Image of the heavenly.</hi> Not that we do now bear the Image of the heavenly, but we ſhall in time to come alſo bear the Image of the heavenly; that is, as certainly as we have born the Image of the earthy, ſo certainly ſhall we alſo, when the time ſhall come, bear the Image of the heavenly; that is, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and Saints did then experimentally know what it was to bear the Image of the earthy, ſo by faith they did as certainly believe that they ſhould alſo bear the Image of the heavenly. And to that Image that the Apoſtle ſpake of, that he and the Saints then were in, of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> that was made a living ſoul, which was not mans body that was made of the Earth, but that of man which was made in the Image and likeneſs of God. I pray take notice! man in the creation was not made God, he was but made in the Image and likeneſs of God. God is unchangeable, and cannot fall. God in man did not change, it was that in man that was made like God, that changed, his Image was changeable; which is well worth our taking notice of, which if we did, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience would tell us the truth of it, how Gods Image changes in us. And man in the creation was not ſo made in the Image and likeneſs of God, but that he might change (as he did) in eating of the forbidden fruit; not by the Command of God, but contrary to Gods Command.</p>
            <p>To that ſtate of the Saints in this life, which was made in the Image of God, and ſo made as it may be changeable by eating of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152785:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> the forbidden fruit, doth what I have here already writ, for the moſt part, tend unto; that as they have born the Image of the earthy, and ſo was the woman that was deceived and in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: for the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 13, 14. Adam was firſt formed, then Eve: And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, was in the tranſgreſſion. Adam</hi> here cannot be taken for the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> made of the Earth; for ſo he eat of the forbidden fruit, as did the woman, and was deceived, and in the tranſgreſſion with the woman; and for his offence judgment came upon all men to condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12 verſe to the 20 verſe. But <hi>Adam</hi> here muſt be Jeſus, who was made a quickning Spirit, and is Lord from Heaven: And he was firſt formed, (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle does not here ſay, made as a Creature, but formed) he was in the form and likeneſs of God before the World was, and the World was made by him. This <hi>Adam</hi> in man, that is, Jeſus in man was not deceived, neither doth this Jeſus in man enter into the tranſgreſſion: But <hi>Eve,</hi> ſo called becauſe ſhe was the Mother of all living, ſhe that had her beginning after <hi>Adam,</hi> and was taken out of <hi>Adam,</hi> (mark that) ſhe was the woman that was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and found in the tranſgreſſion; that which was taken out of <hi>Adam,</hi> and was bone of <hi>Adam</hi>'s bone, and fleſh of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fleſh, and given to <hi>Adam</hi> of God to be an Help-meet for <hi>Adam,</hi> this was deceived, and was in the tranſgreſſion.

            <p>Chriſt is compared to the man, and the Church to the woman, <hi>Epheſians</hi> the fifth Chapter; and the Saints are compared to a woman bringing forth a man child, <hi>Revelations</hi> the 12th Chapter. All they that can read it in the myſtery, in ſome meaſure, degree or other, who knows what it is to have the woman in them ſaved in Child-bearing, that is, to know that in man which was deceived and found in the tranſgreſſion, to be again ſaved in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Child Jeſus, in bearing and bringing forth in them that which ſaves from ſin; and that which ſaves from ſin, is that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in them that was not deceived; that of God in man that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver changed, but was, and is, and ever ſhall be the ſame, and is the quickning Spirit the Lord from Heaven, and the heavenly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that we ſhall in time bear, if we continue in Faith, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Holineſs with Sobriety.</p>
            <p>It was Gods promiſe, that the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head; it was not the woman that was to bruiſe the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152785:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> Serpents head, (mark that) but the ſeed of the woman: Not mans being drawn forth by the Spirit, or the goings, or the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of man by the Spirit of Jeſus in man; that was in man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, that was not to bruiſe the Serpents head, but the ſeed of the woman was to bruiſe the Serpents head. <hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, his name is Emmanuel, God in us,</hi> Mat. 1. 23. The Virgin that knew no man, brought forth Jeſus the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 34, 35. That is the ſeed that bruiſes the Serpents head; that is that in man that knoweth nothing of man; that wherein there is nothing of man joyned to it, as is in mans being drawn, lead, or going out to act by the Spirit of Jeſus in him; there the Serpents ſelf, or a mans own will, is ready to bruiſe the heel of it. The feet is the walking or going part of man, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which man walks; and the heel is the hindermoſt part of the foot, and ſo it repreſents the walkings, goings, or drawings forth of man by the Spirit of Jeſus in him; which ſelf or a mans own will, is ready to bruiſe the heel of it, that is, to hurt or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pure operations of the work of the Spirit of Jeſus in man; but the ſeed of the woman, God in us, the Son of God, Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, this bruiſes the head of the Serpent. The head is that part of the body wherein the life and underſtanding is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, it is the ſeat of that which makes wiſe, and it is the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the Creature. And this ſeed of the woman, God in us, the Son of God, Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, is that ſeed which bruiſes the head of the Serpent in us, bruiſes the head of ſelf or a mans own will in us, bruiſes the life of ſelf or a mans will, bruiſes its wiſdom or underſtanding, bruiſes whatever is uppermoſt in man. God did not promiſe that the ſeed of the woman ſhould ſlay or kill the Serpent, ſo as that there ſhould be no life or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Serpent; (mark that) no, there was to be an enmity between them, between the woman and the Serpent, and between the womans ſeed and the Serpents ſeed: And although the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent had his head bruiſed by the ſeed of the woman, yet the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſhould bruiſe the heel of the womans ſeed: (mark that) The Serpent was not to bruiſe the heel of the woman, although God put enmity between the Serpent and the woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the womans ſeed and the Serpents ſeed; and ſo great an enmity, that the Serpent was to bruiſe the heel of the womans ſeed; and the ſeed of that woman, not the woman, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed was to bruiſe the head of the Serpent. Man in his goings
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152785:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> forth by the leadings or drawings of the ſpirit of Jeſus in him, is not to bruiſe the Serpents head, but it is Jeſus in him, by whom man is drawn forth to do what he doth in obedience to God; it is he, it is that ſeed of the woman that is to bruiſe the Serpents head, ſo that man muſt be nothing in bruiſing the Serpents head, but God muſt be all in the doing thereof.</p>
            <p>And doth not experience teach us the truth thereof? do we not find that although God in us, Jeſus that ſaves from ſin doth bruiſe the head of the Serpent in us (ſelf or mans will) wherein the life of the Serpent and its wiſdom is placed, and what is upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in Man, is bruiſed by the ſeed of the Woman in us; yet there remains a life or motion in this Serpents ſelf or mans will, that doth bruiſe the heel of the Womans ſeed in us; that is, it hurts or hinders the hindermoſt part of the pure operations or workings of the ſeed of the woman in us, that is, of Jeſus in us; and it muſt be this Jeſus in us, and he alone in us that can bruiſe the head of the Serpent in us, and man muſt be but an inſtrument in his hand, and not to move therein, but as moved by Jeſus in him, that ſo God may be all in all, to work both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And yet this woman that was deceived, and in the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall be ſaved in Child-bearing, in bearing the Child whoſe name is <hi>God in us,</hi> the Son of God, Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, which is conceived in the pure Virgins ſeed in man, in that in man that knew no man (that is, that knew nothing of ſelf or, the will of man) but knew onely the will of God, it is that in man that knew nothing of man, (that is, of mans ſelf or will) by joyning with it, or condeſcending to it; that is the Virgins ſeed in man, which conceived God in us, the Son of God, Jeſus that ſaves from ſin; and this Conception of the Virgins ſeed in us, is wrought and brought to paſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, the power of the higheſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us, and over-ſhadowing of us, it is the great power of God by the holy Spirit, joyning with that ſeed of God in man, that never condeſcended or yielded to ſelf in man, or to mans will in the temptation, but did oppoſe it, and diſcovered the temptation in man to be contrary to Gods will; that is, that they ſhould not eat of the fruit of the tree in the midſt of the garden, and told man the danger if he yielded to the temptation, that he ſhould die; and after man had yielded to the temptation, ſhewed him his nakedneſs, his being ſtripped or made naked as to that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152785:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> holineſs and righteouſneſs that God had made them in, and made them ſerviceable of the juſtice of God towards them for their tranſgreſſion, which made them afraid of God. To this Virgins ſeed in man, that was thus in man before the fall, and continued in man after the fall, the great power of God by the Holy Ghoſt joyns with; and by this conjunction or joyning together of theſe two ſeeds, (if they may be ſo call'd) that is, the ſeed of God in us, &amp; the ſeed of God without us; that is, the power of God within us, and the power of God without us (which is all of one kind and nature, as is the ſeed of the man, and the ſeed of the woman) here cometh the conception of the Son of God in us, Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, which being born and brought forth in the life, cannot ſin: 1 <hi>John 3. 9. Whoſoever is horn of God, cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God;</hi> it is the birth and bringing forth of the ſeed of God in us, it is that in us cannot ſin, becauſe it is born of God. 1 <hi>John 3. 8. He that committeth ſin is of the Devil, for the devil ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the beginning:</hi> he that ſins, or that which is ſin, is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinneth from the beginning; this beginning is not to be underſtood from the beginning of time in which God created all things, for then all things were very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. They were like God as God is good; but from the beginning of the Devil, the Devil ſinned, ſin was the firſt beginning of the Devil, and ſo he, or that which commits ſin, is of the Devil, and when ſin began to have a being, the Devil began to have a being. There is but two ſeeds in man, the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent; and what is not of the ſeed of the woman in man, which bringeth forth that which is born of God and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, is of the ſeed of the Serpent in man, the Devil, that which bringeth forth ſin in his own likeneſs: The ſpirit of Jeſus that draweth man forth into obedience to God that cannot ſin, nor doth it ſin, but it is that in man that was in the obedience to God that ſins, as once mans will was in obedience to God, but mans will going out of the obedience to God, was that which brought forth ſin in man.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſaid, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 14, 15. that the woman being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was in the tranſgreſſion; Notwithſtanding</hi> (that is, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder it, but) <hi>ſhe ſhall be ſaved in child-bearing, if ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in faith, and charity, and holineſs with ſobriety:</hi> If ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that ſhe was in faith wherein the child Jeſus was born; <hi>John 1. 12. as many as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152785:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> received him, to them he gave power to be the ſons of God, even to them that believed in his Name.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. <hi>By grace we are ſaved through faith, and that not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> By theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures it is plain, that Faith is that in man that God (as I may ſo ſay) makes uſe of for the bringing forth this child Jeſus to ſave us from ſin: In the bearing of this Child the woman that was deceived, and in the tranſgreſſion is ſaved, if ſhe continue in faith; that is, in that faith that God purifies the heart with; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the tranſgreſſion ſhe went out of faith, out of the believing God, into the believing of the Serpent, and ſo her heart was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; and to ſave her, ſhe muſt be brought into that faith that purifies her heart; and there muſt not onely be faith, which God makes uſe of, for the bringing forth this child Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, but there muſt be a continuing in it, it muſt continue to the end.</p>
            <p>And Charity, which is the height of Love, that muſt continue in Faith, which the Apoſtle in the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 13. ſaith, that although they had all Faith, and thereby did great things, as to remove mountains, and other great works as he there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet all was nothing without Charity, and Charity he ſaith is greater than Faith.</p>
            <p>And Holineſs muſt continue with Faith and Charity: to be holy, that is to be like God; 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 15, 16. As he that hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation, becauſe it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy;</hi> and to all theſe, Sobriety is to be joyned. To be ſober, Rom. 12. 3. that is, to <hi>have a low and mean eſſence of our ſelves.</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, teacheth them that are ſaved to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to lively ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent world.</hi> Theſe all muſt and do attend to and with the Child-bearing of the Woman that ſaves her out of the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and where theſe are wanting, or any of them, what true marks, ſigns, manifeſtations, or knowledge is there that any one can ſay they have, that the child Jeſus is born in them, and that the woman in them is ſaved out of the tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>But if it be objected, if the woman in the figure or myſtery that was deceived, and in the tranſgreſſion be mans being drawn by the ſpirit, or the goings or leadings forth of man by the ſpirit of Jeſus in man; then how is God in us, or the Son of God, or Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, the ſeed of this woman that was deceived, and in the tranſgreſſion?</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:152785:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>To that I anſwer, That the Woman was deceived, and in the tranſgreſſion knew man, ſhe knew the will of man, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended and joyned to and with the will of man, in the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and in ſo doing, the Serpents ſeed was brought forth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience was brought forth, which is the ſeed of the Serpent. When God in the Creation made the Creatures on the Earth, the ſeed of what he made was in them; and ſo it may be ſaid of the Serpent, when he took his firſt being in man, his ſeed was in him, diſobedience was in him, and between that ſeed of diſobedience, and the ſeed of the Woman, that is that ſeed of God in man, that never condeſcended to the will of man in his diſobedience, but ſtood in obedience to God: There is by God put an everlaſting enmity between thoſe two ſeeds; and the ſeed of the Woman, that is God in us, or the Son of God, or Jeſus that ſaves from ſin; that is another ſeed of the Woman, and not that ſeed which knew the will of Man, and condeſcended and joyned with Mans will in the tranſgreſſion; but it is a ſeed in man that never knew man, that is, the will of man by joyning with it, or condeſcending to mans will in his diſobedience, but it ever did and doth oppoſe the will of man in his diſobedience, it is a Virgins ſeed that knew no man.</p>
            <p>And this is as great a myſtery to the Wiſdom of this World, as it was that an outward Virgin that never knew an outward man, ſhould bring forth a Son: The woman that this Virgins ſeed ſhall ſave, is that in man that was loſt by the tranſgreſſion. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this; before man tranſgreſſed, he was drawn and went forth in the doing what he did by the ſpirit of God in him, I hope none will deny that. God breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a living Soul; man being thus made alive, he was by the drawings of the ſpirit, or the goings or leadings of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus in him, carried out by a principle of love to yield an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, and in and by his tranſgreſſion he died; that is, man as to his being drawn, going, or being led forth by the ſpirit of Jeſus in him, in obedience to God in that love that he had to God. In the tranſgreſſion, that obedience that he had to God died, which he was in before the tranſgreſſion, and drawn, led, or went forth in that obedience by the ſpirit of Jeſus in him: that obedience died, that is, it died as to mans part, as to mans obeying of God; and ſo man was loſt as to his love and obedience to God; and the woman being ſaved, is the reſtoring of this love and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152785:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> obedience again in man to God, which is done in the Virgins ſeed, in the womans bearing the Child Jeſus, the Son of God, God in us, who came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</p>
            <p>What is now required of the woman to continue in to be ſaved in child-bearing, that is, ſhe is to continue in faith, charity, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſobriety; theſe all were in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, and ſo man may be ſaid to die in the day that he eat of the forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p>There was faith in <hi>Adam</hi> before he fell: <hi>Adam</hi> before he fell he believed all that God had ſaid to him to be true, and he obeyed God in all that he had commanded him to do, and he confeſſed the truth of what God had ſpoken to him, and of his obedience to God in and by the woman: It was the woman that ſaid, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree in the midſt of the garden, God hath ſaid ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it leſt ye die, (and this was ſpoken by the man in the woman, as being led or guided by the ſpirit of Jeſus in him, to give this anſwer to the Serpent) I pray mark, God did make known his Commandment to the man, before the woman had a being, that is, before ſhe had a body ſeparated from mans body: man makes no acknowledgement of what God had commanded him to do, or of his faith in believing the truth of what God had commanded, or of his obedience to God, but as he did it in and by the woman; it was the woman that acknowledged the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and their believing of it, and their obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the acknowledgement of their faith and obedience, it was in this that ſhe declared what God had commanded them to do, and what he had commanded them not to do, and the penalty, if they tranſgreſſed, and then they had not broken Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>The Serpent never ſet upon man to tempt him, before he had a woman given to him as an Help-meet; but after he had a woman given to him, to be an Help-meet for him, then he ſet upon him to tempt him in and by the woman (read it in the myſtery who can) I hope none will own themſelves to be ſo ignorant as to ſay, they believe the Serpent did not tempt the man, becauſe the Scripture ſpeaketh of the Woman and the Serpent to have all the diſcourſe in the temptations; but yet the Scripture ſaith, that ſhe took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave alſo to her husband
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152785:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> with her, and he did eat, and gave alſo to her husband with her, and he did eat, that is, at the very ſame time and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that the woman eat, the husband eat alſo with her, they eat together; by which it is clear that the temptation was the ſame in the husband that it was in the woman; but God is pleaſed to ſet it forth to be the woman that was tempted, the more to make known the myſtery of the creating of man, and of mans fall, and given it the name that the woman was deceived, and in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, <hi>notwithſtanding ſhe ſhall be ſaved in Child-bearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Faith was in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, ſo Charity was in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall; the height of love was in <hi>Adam</hi> before he fell, there was no love in the heart of man to any creature before the fall, mans heart was filled, as I may ſo ſay, with love to God, the love of the Creation, nor of any Creature was not entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mans heart before the fall, no not to <hi>Eve,</hi> but onely as God had made her an Help-meet for man, but he knew her not till after the fall; and Holineſs was in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, as he was made in the Image of God, and Sobriety was in man, before the fall man had no high thoughts or eſteem of himſelf.</p>
            <p>While man ſtood ſtedfaſt in his faith, believing the truth of what God had ſpoken, and his love remained unchangeable, and his holineſs unblemiſhed, and his ſobriety unmoved, mans heart was like a pleaſant and delightful Garden; and while mans heart was thus as a garden, and all that man did was done by mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn or led, or going forth thereunto by the ſpirit of Jeſus in him; for who dare ſay that man before his being tempted, did any thing that was not the work of God in him; and man in the garden, and in his being led, drawn, or going forth by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus in him, ſubtilly gets into him, and perſwades him in the time of his being drawn, led, or going forth by the ſpirit of God (or Jeſus) firſt to queſtion the truth of what God had ſaid, and then to a deſire to be as Gods. Man was in the Image of God before the temptation, as God made him, and ſo in that Image he was led or drawn, or went forth to do whatſoever he did by the ſpirit of God in him: But ſubtilly the temptation cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a deſire in him to be as Gods, and not to be contented to be led, drawn, or guided by another, as he was in that ſtate that God had made him in, but to be as gods, to be of himſelf and to do of himſelf; that is, to be as gods, to have no dependency upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but of himſelf; and thus man in the garden, and in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152785:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> time of his being drawn, led, or carried forth by the ſpirit of God (or Jeſus) was tempted by the Serpent, the ſubtilty of ſelf in him, and by the temptation deceived, the temptation prevailed in him to a deſire to be as gods.</p>
            <p>Man as he was made in the Image of God, ſo he had in him neither deſire nor will to eat of the forbidden fruit; but yet he was not ſo made in the Image of God, but that Deſire and Will got up in him to eat of the forbidden fruit (as he did.) In the midſt of the garden was the tree of life, Jeſus that ſaves from ſin is the tree of life, this was in the midſt of man, as he was made in the Image of God, and the fruit that this tree brings forth, is obedience to God, and of this fruit of the garden man was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God freely to eat of, he eat no other meats, that is, as the natural body takes into it outward meat and eats it, and ſo is filled and ſatisfied with it, ſo man as made in the Image of God, he took in of the fruit of the tree of life (Jeſus) which brought forth the fruit of obedience in him, and man eat thereof, that is, he filled and ſatisbed himſelf with obedience to God, as he was in the Image of God: As the outward body takes in and eats and fills and ſatisfies it ſelf with outward meat, ſo man, as made in the Image of God, eat, took in, filled and ſatisfied himſelf with obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God.</p>
            <p>And the tree of knowledge of good and evil was in the midſt of the garden, that is, man knew Gods will what he ſhould do, and that was good; and what he ſhould not do, and that was evil; and for a time man ſtood in his obedience to God, eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and lived in obedience to God for a time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the tree of knowledge of good and evil was in the midſt of the garden, God had made known in man what was good and what was evil, which was not forbidden to be in man, what God did forbid was evil, man was not to do evil, but mans knowing of what God had forbidden was not an evil, ſo the tree of knowing what was good that God had commanded to do, and knowing what was evil that God had forbidden to do, was not an evil tree in it ſelf, and therefore not forbidden to be in man, God doth continue it ſtill in man; it was the eating of it, or the fruit of it, and touching of the fruit of it that was forbidden; and man did not eat of the fruit thereof as ſoon as he was in the woman tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by the Serpent, but at or in the beginning of the temptation he ſtood in his obedience to God, in eating of the fruit of the tree
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152785:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> of life, as appears by his acknowledging in the woman, <hi>Thou mayſt eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midſt of the garden, God hath ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it leſt ye die;</hi> here man continued in his obedience, eating of the fruit of the tree of life (although tempted) and in the acknowledging Gods Command to the full height or largeneſs of it, in anſwer to that doubtful queſtion of the Serpent, <hi>Ye, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden?</hi> take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how the Serpent leaves out Gods Command and the Name of the tree that God had commanded not to eat of, that ſo his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation might the eaſier take place, and by it got into the man by the woman, and onely puts it in as a queſtion, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden?</hi> when it was Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſaying, <hi>Of every tree of the garden thou mayſt freely eat, but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2. 16, 17. mark, here is a Command forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but there is nothing ſaid of not touching the fruit thereof; and when man by Jeſus in him gave an anſwer to the Serpent by the woman, and that while he ſtood in his obedience eating of the fruit of the Tree of life, he tells the Serpent, that they were not onely forbidden to eat of the fruit of the Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil that was in the midſt of the garden, but they were not to touch the fruit of it. By which it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that at the firſt beginning of the temptation man did not yield thereunto, but ſtood faſt in his obedience, in feeding upon the fruit of the Tree of life in him (Jeſus) the Tree that brought forth the fruit of obedience in him, and ſo kept him from ſin.</p>
            <p>But the Serpent, for ſo may the temptation be fitly compared to a Serpent, who can twiſt and turn himſelf round and round, he continued in his body turning it about the Tree of Knowledge. As I have ſeen the likeneſs of a Serpent by man pictured upon the likeneſs of a Tree without me, ſo have I experimentally ſeen the Serpent within me upon the Tree of Knowledge. And although the Scripture doth not plainly ſpeak it in plain words, yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teaches me, and the Scripture ſpeaks to that purpoſe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Serpent had ſo full an anſwer given to him, that not onely the fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil was forbidden to be eaten, but it was alſo forbidden to be touched; yet the Serpent would not leave his temptation in his doubtful
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152785:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> queſtion, whether God had ſaid they ſhould not eat of every Tree in the garden; but the Serpent did continue in his temptation, therein tempting man, till he had cauſed man in the woman to doubt or queſtion the truth of what God had commanded: for if man in the woman had not doubted or queſtioned the truth of what God had commanded, he could never have believed the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, when he made God a lyar: God had ſaid to the man, In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die. <hi>And the Serpent ſaid to man in the woman, Ye ſhall not ſurely die. For God doth know, that in the day;</hi> mark that, God had ſaid, That in the day man eat thereof, man ſhould ſurely die. <hi>The Serpent ſaid to man in the woman, Ye ſhall not ſurely die.</hi> And that <hi>God knows that in the day ye eat thereof, your eyes ſhall be open: and ye ſhall be as gods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good and evil.</hi> In that day that God had ſaid, they ſhould die; in that day the Serpent ſaid, they ſhould be as gods. Can any one believe that the Serpent could have perſwaded man by the woman, to have believed this notorious lye of his, if he had not continued in his temptation twiſting, winding, and turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about the Tree of knowledge in man; and in that cauſing him, in the woman, firſt to queſtion the truth of what God had ſaid, that he ſhould not eat of every Tree of the garden? Before the Serpent could perſwade him into a belief, by the woman, that they ſhould not ſurely die, if they did eat of the fruit that God had forbidden them to eat of; and not onely ſo, but perſwaded him to a belief that God knew, that in the day they eat thereof, their eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be as gods, knowing good and evil: I ſay, can any one believe that the Serpent could perſwade man that he ſhould not ſurely die in the day that he eat of the fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, if he had not firſt prevailed with man in the firſt part of the temptation, to queſtion or doubt whether or no it were true, that God had ſaid, that they ſhould not eat of every Tree of the garden.</p>
            <p>And thus when the Serpent had prevailed with man to bring him to doubt or queſtion the truth of what God had ſaid, and to believe the lye that the Serpent had ſaid when the temptation had prevailed to this; then man in the woman ſaw that the Tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eye, and to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make wiſe, then by the woman man took of the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and did eat.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:152785:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And thus the deſire of the will got to be uppermoſt in man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the forbidden fruit. Man then did not obey God according to that knowledge that he had of God, but had a greater deſire after the fruit of the Tree of knowledge, than he had after the fruit of the Tree of life; which fruit was obedience, which for a time he had eaten and lived in; but when the deſire was carried out after knowledge to eat of that fruit, and live of that, then man died in his life of obedience, then man died in that very day of the week that he eat of the forbidden fruit, he then died ſo as he ceaſed to obey God in what he knew of God. And then he eat, he filled and ſatisfied himſelf with knowledge, and deſired knowledge more than obedience to God in what he knew of God. And although knowledge, while obedience was joyned with it, was a good Tree, yet when man did not continue yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to God in what he knew of God, then knowledge it became an evil Tree, and brought forth the evil fruit of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which was forbidden, which man was not to eat of, nor to touch it: for in the day he eat of it, he was ſurely to die; and did die in the day of the week that he eat of the fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, but not a death of the body that lived hundreds of years after his eating of the forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p>Jeſus was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. and ſo he was in man as made in the Image of God, he was the true Light that gave him the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, what was Gods will that he ſhould do, and what was Gods will that he ſhould not do. And ſo knowledge, as a Tree, was in man when man was in the Image of God, and while man yielded obedience to God, according to the knowledge that he had of God, it was a Tree of knowledge of good; but when man had the knowledge of what was the will of God, and did not obey God in that knowledge, then that knowledge that was good in man, became evil: And ſo the Tree of knowledge of good, became a Tree of the knowledge of actual evil, and brought forth the fruit of diſobedience, which was ſin, which man was not to eat of, nor touch; man then knew evil by doing of evil, which before he onely knew evil as it was what God had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be done; and in that knowledge of evil was no ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, no Command of God broken in the knowledge of that to be evil that God had forbidden to be eaten of.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:152785:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And if any ſhould think it not to be true that the Serpent ſhould ſet upon man to tempt him when he was in that glorious ſtate of his heart, being filled with Gods love, and his love to God and upon God onely, and he in that ſtate of love, to do all that he did by the Spirit of God, drawing, leading, or carrying him forth to do what he did; and then in that time when he was eating of the fruit of the Tree of life in him, for the Serpent to ſet upon him as he did, to tempt him not to be contented with that ſtate that God had made him in his Image, but have a deſire to be as gods.</p>
            <p>I deſire them that queſtion the truth of it, to conſider Chriſts temptations, and when the Devil ſet upon him to tempt him, and read it in <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and you ſhall find it to be at that time when he had fulfilled all righteouſneſs, and was full of the Holy Ghoſt, and had that manifeſtation by a voice from Heaven, that he was Gods beloved Son, in whom he was well pleaſed: And then immediately the Devil ſet upon him to tempt him; and what was he tempted to? He was tempted not to be contented with that condition that he was then in; as being an hungry, he was tempted not to be contented with it, but to make uſe of a means that God had not appointed to ſatisfie his hunger. And the like may be obſerved in the other temptations. And although there was a declaration from Heaven, that he was Gods beloved ſon, and that God was well pleaſed with him, yet the Devil tempts him twice with a doubt or queſtion whether he were the ſon of God, in theſe words: <hi>If thou be the ſon of God, command theſe ſtones to be made bread. And if thou be the ſon of God, caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> And the Devil brings Scripture, if I may ſo ſay, to prove that he might yield to him in his temptation in caſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down: <hi>For it is written, he ſhall give his angels charge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> Both theſe temptations were, that by his yielding to them he might have or manifeſt a further or another manifeſtation or making known of himſelf to be the ſon of God, than that manifeſtation or making known of him to be the ſon of God, that the Father had given of him from Heaven. But Chriſt did not yield to any of the temptations (man at firſt reſiſted the temptation of the Serpent, and did not yield to it, yet man did not as Chriſt did, continue reſiſting the temptation, and ſo he was prevailed with and overcome, and eat of the forbidden
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152785:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> fruit;) but Chriſt was ſo far from yielding to the temptation, that he called the Devil <hi>Satan,</hi> and bad him get him hence: <hi>for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Mat. 3. 19. Mark, that which tempted Jeſus, ought to have done him worſhip, and ſerved him onely, as being his Lord and God. And if the Devil thus ſet upon him that was God in man, is it to be queſtioned that the Serpent would not nor did not ſet upon man that was but the Image of God, and that in the time when he did what he did by the leadings, drawings, or going forth of the ſpirit of God (or Jeſus) in him?</p>
            <p>Jeſus the Son of God <hi>was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without ſin,</hi> Heb. 4. 15.</p>
            <p>If it be objected thou call'ſt the Serpent ſubtile, ſelf, or mans will, was there any ſuch thing in Chriſt to tempt him? I deſire the Objecter to read and well conſider Chriſts Prayer the night in which he was betrayed, and the place where he prayed in, it was in a garden, <hi>John 18. 1. (Adam</hi> was in a garden when the Serpent tempted him) His Prayer was, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Matth. 26. 39. <hi>And being in an agony he prayed more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of bloud falling down to the ground,</hi> Luke 22. 44. Is it not plain by theſe Scriptures, that there was in Chriſt a will and deſire that the Cup might paſs from him? but he yielded not to that will and deſire, but reſigned and gave up all to the will of the Father, and ſo he did not ſin: Is it not plain by theſe Scriptures, that although Chriſt as man had never ſinned, never did any thing contrary to the will of the Father, and all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt in that body, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. yet what a conflict or ſtriving was their between the will and deſire as man, and the will and deſire as God, as he was the ſon of God, the onely begotten ſon of God? What was it elſe, but the ſtrife or conflict between the deſire, if it were poſſible to have that Cup paſs from him, and a will that it might paſs from him, and a deſire and will that was in him, that that deſire and will that would have the Cup to paſs from him, ſhould not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but that the will of the Father ſhould be done, whoſe will it was that he ſhould drink of that Cup? Was not this the caſe of the agony that cauſed ſuch a ſweat that the drops thereof were as great drops of bloud?</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:152785:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>If Chriſt, as man, who always had done the will of the Father, found it ſo hard to bring the will to be reſigned and given up to the will of the Father, Can it be believed by any of thoſe who have known the reſurrection of Jeſus in them, (and have known a time when their will and deſire have been after what God hath forbidden) that it is an eaſie work in them to have their wills reſigned and given up to the will of God in all things? They know that it is God that muſt work in them both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>Jeſus, as he was the onely begotten ſon of God, ſo he could not be prevailed with, or overcome by the temptation. It was the onely begotten ſon of God in that body born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that kept that body from yielding to the temptation; (mark that) and it is the begotten ſon of God in us, and that onely, that muſt and doth keep us from yielding to the temptation. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin: for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 John 3. 9. God may be ſaid to have two ſons, one a created ſon, as was <hi>Adam,</hi> Luke 3. 38. and that ſon, although made in Gods Image, yet he yielded to the temptation, and ſo ſinned. The other was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſon, which is Jeſus, which is the ſame with the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and was and is God, by whom the created ſon was made: and this begotten ſon cannot ſin, becauſe the ſeed of God remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him.</p>
            <p>And the want of a true underſtanding of theſe two ſons, makes that great difference that is amongſt thoſe that call themſelves the ſons of God; the one believing they cannot live in this body without ſinning, the other believes a ſtate of perfection, and that ſuch a life is attainable while the outward body hath an outward life: That there may be a life or living without ſin, which is true indeed; and it were well if all thoſe that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, underſtood what it is to live and not ſin, and what it is in them that live and do not ſin; if they did, the Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that believe they ſhall ſin, and that they cannot live while the life of this body continues without ſin, would not be ſo great as it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> the created ſon of God, made in Gods Image, and had Faith, Charity, Holineſs, and Sobriety, he yielded to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſinned. And does not men and women do ſo now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though reſtored to <hi>Adam</hi>'s created Eſtate? Do they not find the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152785:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> Serpent bruiſing the heel of the ſeed of the woman? If they do not, then how do they find what God ſaid to be true? God ſaid, that the Serpent ſhould bruiſe the heel of the ſeed of the woman; but the begotten ſon of God in man that cannot ſin, the ſeed of God in man that cannot ſin, neither did it condeſcend to ſin in <hi>Adam;</hi> nor doth it now condeſcend to ſin in any that are reſtored to that ſtate that <hi>Adam</hi> was in before the fall. And this is that that lives without ſin, that lives and cannot ſin, it is Jeſus in us, the onely begotten ſon of God: And this is that life that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I am crucified with Chriſt:</hi> (that is, dead with Chriſt) <hi>Nevertheleſs, I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the ſon of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth not moſt of them that profeſs themſelves the ſons of God, and know any thing of the work of God in their hearts, but will own Jeſus Chriſt to be raiſed from death to life in them, and to be alive in them? And ask them if they believe that this Jeſus Chriſt that lives in them, ſins? they will anſwer, No, he lives in them without ſin. Then ask them that believe a ſtate of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and living without ſin while this body lives, what is it in them that does not ſin? whether it be the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and in the tranſgreſſion, that lives without ſin in them, or whether it be Jeſus the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> that lives without ſin in them? They will anſwer, The ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> it is Jeſus in them that ſinneth not in them; and without that Jeſus in them, they cannot live without ſin. So then where is the difference between thoſe that believe they cannot live in this body and not ſin, and yet they believe that Jeſus lives in that body, and he cannot ſin; and thoſe that believe that there is a life attainable while this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lives, that does not ſin; but this life that doth not ſin, is the life of Jeſus in them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> did not continue in that ſtate that God had made him in; the Serpent gets into the garden into mans heart, and the firſt work the Serpents ſubtile ſelf doth, he ſets upon man in his faith, and brings man firſt to queſtion the truth of what God had commanded, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden?</hi> and then to a not believing of what God had ſaid, that they ſhould ſurely die; but man believed the Serpent that ſaid, they ſhould not ſurely die, although they eat of the fruit that God had forbidden them to eat of. Here man by yielding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152785:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the temptation, loſt his faith, his faith did not continue in him; and then he loſt his love that he had to God, he was afraid of God; and there is no fear in love, perfect love caſteth out fear; and then he loſt his holineſs, the Image of God, and alſo loſt his ſobriety; pride got up in him a deſire to be as gods.</p>
            <p>And thus man, although he had before his fall Faith, Charity, Holineſs, and Sobriety, yet he not continuing in them, was the cauſe of the fall; and the woman that is ſaved in Child-bearing, muſt not onely have Faith, Charity, Holineſs, and Sobriety, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had before his fall, but muſt continue in them: ſo that the ſaving of the woman is not onely a reſtoring of that again in man that was loſt, but a preſerving man in that ſtate that he was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall; which onely can be done by the power of that Jeſus in her that the Devil could not prevail with in his temptations. It is the bringing forth of that Child Jeſus in man now, that is the onely begotten ſon of God that muſt keep and preſerve man, that he is not prevailed with and overcome by the ſubtile Serpents temptations, as <hi>Adam</hi> was.</p>
            <p>I know there may be much wrought in man; and yet the Child Jeſus not born, nor the woman ſaved out of the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>But firſt, to ſpeak ſomething of Jeſus as he is the Light to all, and a Saviour to ſome that never heard of Jeſus born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> and crucified by the Jews. Chriſt Jeſus, as he is the Light, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. ſo he is the true Light that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth every man that comes into the world. And ſo Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, is in all that cometh into the world, <hi>that was made by him, but they knew him not. And when he came to his own, his own they received him not. But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believed on his Name: Which were born not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten ſon, that whoſoever believed in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> Jeſus the onely begotten ſon of God, as he is the Light, ſo he is given of God to all the world to ſave them, to keep them from periſhing, and to give them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal light, if they will receive him, and believe in him. He is a Light in all and to all that have not heard of him by that name of Jeſus, as born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet have heard of him, and knew him, that is, as there is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152785:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> Serpent bruiſing the heel of the ſeed of the woman? If they do not, then how do they find what God ſaid to be true? God ſaid, that the Serpent ſhould bruiſe the heel of the ſeed of the woman; but the begotten ſon of God in man that cannot ſin, the ſeed of God in man that cannot ſin, neither did it condeſcend to ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> nor doth it now condeſcend to ſin in any that are reſtored to that ſtate that <hi>Adam</hi> was in before the fall.

            </p>
            <p>Doth not moſt of them that profeſs themſelves the ſons of God, and know any thing of the work of God in their hearts, but will own Jeſus Chriſt to be raiſed from death to life in them, and to be alive in them? And ask them if they believe that this Jeſus Chriſt that lives in them, ſins? they will anſwer, No, he lives in them without ſin. Then ask them that believe a ſtate of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and living without ſin while this body lives, what is it in them that does not ſin? whether it be the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and in the tranſgreſſion, that lives without ſin in them, or whether it be Jeſus the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> that lives without ſin in them? They will anſwer, The ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> it is Jeſus in them that ſinneth not in them; and without that Jeſus in them, they cannot live without ſin. So then where is the difference between thoſe that believe they cannot live in this body and not ſin, and yet they believe that Jeſus lives in that body, and he cannot ſin; and thoſe that believe that there is a life attainable while this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lives, that does not ſin; but this life that doth not ſin, is the life of Jeſus in them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> did not continue in that ſtate that God had made him in; the Serpent gets into the garden into mans heart, and the firſt work the Serpents ſubtile ſelf doth, he ſets upon man in his faith, and brings man firſt to queſtion the truth of what God had commanded, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the garden?</hi> and then to a not believing of what God had ſaid, that they ſhould ſurely die; but man believed the Serpent that ſaid, they ſhould not ſurely die, although they eat of the fruit that God had forbidden them to eat of.

            <p>And thus man, although he had before his fall Faith, Charity, Holineſs, and Sobriety, yet he not continuing in them, was the cauſe of the fall; and the woman that is ſaved in Child-bearing, muſt not onely have Faith, Charity, Holineſs, and Sobriety, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had before his fall, but muſt continue in them: ſo that the ſaving of the woman is not onely a reſtoring of that again in man that was loſt, but a preſerving man in that ſtate that he was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall; which onely can be done by the power of that Jeſus in her that the Devil could not prevail with in his temptations.

He is a Light in all and to all that have not heard of him by that name of Jeſus, as born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet have heard of him, and knew him, that is, as there is

            <p>I read in <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. that <hi>John</hi> heard the number of them that were ſealed for the ſervants of God, a hundred forty and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of all the Tribes of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of each Tribe twelve thouſand. <hi>Dan</hi> who <hi>Jacob</hi> told ſhould be as a Serpent by the way when he told his ſons what ſhould befal them in the laſt days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 17. There was none ſealed of his Tribe, but inſtead of him, <hi>Manaſſes</hi> is put in a ſon of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> (mark that) there is none of the Serpents Tribe to be ſealed, although <hi>Dan</hi>'s Tribe were in the outward Worſhip of God, as were the other Tribes: And of the other Tribes but twelve thouſand of a Tribe ſealed. In all but an hundred forty and four thouſand, which is the number ſealed to be the ſervants of God, of thoſe who had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments written in Tables of ſtones without them, and the Law and the Prophets written in Books without them. Theſe are they that worſhip God in outward forms of Worſhip; the number of them that were ſealed that were the ſervants of God, is eaſily to be numbered, being one hundred forty and four thouſand, which is but a very ſmall number to what a man can number.</p>
            <p>And theſe were all that <hi>John</hi> heard the number of, that were in the outward form of worſhipping of God, that were ſealed to be the ſervants of God unto whom were committed the Oracles of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. And <hi>to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of

What can all theſe in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral forms of the worſhipping of God ſay that they have more, and yet of all theſe there is but twelve thouſand of a Tribe ſealed (may I ſay of an outward form of worſhip) in all but an hundred forty and four thouſand that were the ſervants of God, a very ſmall number in compariſon of what a man can number; and theſe <hi>John</hi> did but hear of to be ſealed for the Servants of God (mark that.)</p>
            <p>After this <hi>John</hi> beheld, and lo, a great multitude which no man could number, of all Nations, Kinreds, and People, and Tongues, ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white Robes, and Palms in their hands, and cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Salvation to our God, which ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> was asked what theſe were, which were arrayed in white Robes, and whence they came?

            <p>Let them know that Jeſus is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world; and he is the tree of Life, and in ſome meaſure, degree, or other, as he is the true light, and lighteth them, ſo he gives unto them ſome knowledge of Gods will what they ſhould do, and what they ſhould not do: God does not reap where he did not ſow, nor gather where he hath not ſtrewed, as the ſlothful ſervant who had not improved his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but hid it in the Earth, charge God falſely therein. The ſower ſowes the word, the word is the ſeed, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. all men are comprehended to be in one or the other of the four parts of ground: the ſeed which is the word is God, <hi>John</hi> 1. In him was life, and the life was the light of men, that was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, God as his Word is in every man that cometh into the world, they were all made by him, made by his word, and without him there was not any thing made; in him was life, and the life was the light of men; the tree of life that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> was the life of God in him, that was Jeſus that was the light in him, that told him what was Gods will that he ſhould do, and what was Gods will that he ſhould not do; and this remains as a tree in all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity, although the appearance thereof is more in ſome than it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome, yet there is ſomething of the light in every man, that convinceth him of an evil, and makes known a good to him; and this did remain in <hi>Adam</hi> after he had eaten of the forbidden fruit, opening his eyes, ſhewing him his nakedneſs, that by his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he had ſhipped himſelf out of that white Robe of Innocency that God had clothed him with, as he had made him in his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, man ſeeing himſelf naked and without that clothing that God had made him in, it made known to him the good that he had loſt by his diſobedience; and it ſhews alſo to man the juſtice of God for his diſobedience, which made him afraid of God, and by his being afraid of Gods juſtice, it made known to him the evil that he had committed by eating of the forbidden fruit.</p>

            <p>The ſeed ſown in the good ground, and in them bringing forth its own likeneſs, made them in the Image of God, made them a Law to themſelves, Jeſus as a light that gave them the knowledge of Gods Law, which in ſubſtance is this, To do that God hath commanded, and to leave undone what God hath forbidden; he wrought obedience in them to Gods Law; and this was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by which the Gentiles did the things contained in Gods Law, and ſo they are a Law to themſelves, and ſo they ſhew the works of the Law written in their hearts; theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by their obedience they ſhew not onely that the Law of God was written in their hearts, but they ſhew the work of the Law of God that was written in their hearts, they made the tree known to be good by the fruits, which few of theſe of the Tribes of the Jews that were in the outward form of worſhip did do,

            <p>
               <hi>And their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> There was in the Gentiles not onely a taking notice of the actions done by them, and the words ſpoken by them, whether they were agreeable to the Law of God writ in their hearts; but ſo much were they brought to an obedience to the Law of God in them, and they thereby became ſuch a Law to themſelves, as that they took notice in themſelves of their very thoughts, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they were, if bad and evil, then their Conſcience (the witneſs of God in them that) accuſed them for their bad and evil thoughts: There was that in them that did not onely judge and condemn them for evil works done by them, or evil words ſpoken by them, but they were accuſed for evil thoughts; and there was that in them that juſtified them for doing the things that were good contained in Gods Law, and for ſpeaking what was good, and it excuſed them in their thoughts that were good.</p>
            <p>And theſe Gentiles were all Nations, and Kinreds, and People, and Tongues, excepting the Jews; and <hi>Paul</hi> did plainly ſay, that the Gentiles that did the things contained in the Law of God, were the true Jews, and had the true Circumciſion: And thoſe Jews that had the written Law of God without them, and did not keep the Law, although circumciſed without in the fleſh: their Circumciſion by breaking the Law was made Uncircumciſion to them, and they were not the true Jews; ſee from the 15. verſ. to the end of the Chapter: And this <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſpeak of ſuch Gentiles as ſhould believe in Jeſus after the preaching of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Jeſus to them, that was Crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but of thoſe Gentiles that had never heard of that Jeſus; for in the 24th verſe he tells the Jews, that the name of God is blaſphemed among the

            <p>God put no difference between the Jew and the Gentiles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purified their hearts by Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. The Centurion that came to Jeſus to have his ſervant healed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. he was a Gentile, and was not of the outward form of worſhipping God that the Jews were of; and Jeſus ſays of him to the Jews that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, that he had not found ſo great faith, no not in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as he he had found in that Gentile; and farther tells them, that many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven, but the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth: Mark, many ſhall come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, thoſe many they muſt be Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and ſuch as were not counted the Children of the Kingdom of Heaven; that is, they were not counted the Children of the Kingdom of Heaven by the Jews, which were in the outward form of worſhipping God, nor are they counted the Children of the Kingdom of Heaven, by thoſe that count themſelves the Children of the Kingdom, becauſe they themſelves are in the outward forms of worſhipping of God, and therefore they count themſelves the Children of the Kingdom of Heaven, as did the Jews; becauſe they were in the outward form of worſhipping God, they looked upon themſelves as the onely Children of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo Jeſus calls them, when he ſaith the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſs, where ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth: None can think Jeſus's meaning to be, that the Children of the Kingdom that are the right heirs to it, that they ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth: No, that cannot be; for as they are Children of God, ſo they are Heirs, Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 17. and it is the Fathers pleaſure to give them the Kingdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 32.

            <p>Jeſus tells the Jews that believed on him, <hi>John</hi> 3. who told Jeſus that they were of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and that God was their Father, and Jeſus tells them that he knew that they were of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſeed, but they ſeek to kill him becauſe his word had no place in them, And when they told him <hi>Abraham</hi> was their Father, Jeſus ſays to them, That if they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, they would do the works of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but now ye ſeek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth which he heard of God, this did not <hi>Abraham</hi> (that is, <hi>Abraham</hi> did not ſeek to kill him.) But notwithſtanding they were ſuch as believed on Jeſus, and told him they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and that God was their Father, and he tells them that he knew they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; yet becauſe they went about to kill him for telling them the truth, Jeſus he tells them they were of their Father the Devil, and the luſt of your Father ye will do: <hi>He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him.</hi> Theſe were they that looked upon themſelves to be the Children of the Kingdom, and to have a right to ſit down in it with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> becauſe they were in an outward form of worſhip, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God in the outward worſhip that God had commanded, and they called <hi>Abraham</hi> Father, and that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. And mark further, the Scripture ſaith of them, that they believed on Jeſus, and owned that they had one Father even God; and yet theſe were caſt out of the Kingdom of God into utter darkneſs, Jeſus telling them they were of their Father the Devil, and where their Father was, muſt they not be there alſo with him? and if
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152785:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> any can believe that the Devil is in the Kingdom of Heaven, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> then they may believe that his Children are there alſo; and his Children are thoſe that are in the outward form of worſhipping God, although in an outward form that God hath required to be uſed in his worſhip; and ſay that <hi>Abraham</hi> is their Father, and that they are of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that they have but one Father even God, and that they believe on Jeſus, as did thoſe Jews, and yet Jeſus's Word had no place in them, but they ſeek to kill Jeſus, as did thoſe Jews, for telling them the truth: Mark, they did not kill Jeſus, they did but ſeek to kill Jeſus, as do all thoſe wherein Jeſus is a light in them, and does tell them the truth, what it is that they ſhould do in obedience to God, but they will not do it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus word hath no place in them, and ſo as much as in them lyeth they ſeek to kill Jeſus for telling them the truth, that is, they ſeek to kill him in themſelves, in that they do not do the things contained in the Law of God written within them, nor ſhew the works of the Law of God writ in their hearts, as did the Gentiles that had not the Law of God written without them, and yet they did the things contained in Gods Law, and ſhew'd the work thereof written in their hearts. I ſay, if any man can believe the Devil is in the Kingdom of Heaven, ſitting with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> then they may believe that his Children are in the Kingdom of Heaven with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>

            <p>It is not the high thoughts and eſteem that they have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or that others have of them, as if they were the Children of the Kingdom, that can give then an entrance into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, becauſe they are in an outward form of worſhip; and as to the outward in the doing of ſuch things in it as God hath commanded, and looking upon <hi>Abraham</hi> to be their Father, and that they were of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, and calling God Father, and believing in his Son Jeſus, this cannot give them an entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, there being that in them that will not let Jeſus words have any place in them; and therefore they ſeek to kill Jeſus for telling them the truth; that is, they ſeek to kill Jeſus in them, in that they do not yield obedience to God, in what Jeſus the light in them makes known to be Gods will for them to obey him in; this makes them of their Father the Devil, becauſe they will do his luſts; and if the Father be caſt out, ſure the Children muſt be caſt out with him.

There is the ſame nature of being Children of Wrath, in thoſe that are high in an outward form of worſhipping God, as was <hi>Paul,</hi> who as to his outward life as to men, lived blameleſs; and thoſe that were in no outward form of worſhipping God, as were the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> while they both have their converſations in the luſt of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the mind, pleaſing themſelves in what they do: if they be in an outward form of Worſhip, they pleaſe, content, and ſatisfie themſelves in that outward form of

               <hi>But God, who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he loved us; even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt (by grace we are ſaved) and have raiſed us up together, and have made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Mark, they which having their Converſations in the luſt of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and mind, and thereby were by nature Children of Diſobedience, and ſo Children of Wrath, Children of the Devil; both thoſe that were not in an outward form of worſhipping of God, as were theſe Gentiles the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> and thoſe that were in the higheſt of outward forms of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, as was <hi>Paul:</hi> yet God who is rich in mercy, can and does for his great love ſake, wherewith he loved them, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they are dead in ſins, quicken them together with Chriſt, and ſo raiſe them up together as to make them ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus; as you may ſee more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>

            <p>Jeſus tells the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John 4. that <hi>the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth: for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. Jeruſalem</hi> was the place that God had choſen to be worſhipped in; and ſo it repreſents the true outward form of worſhipping God, wherein God was worſhipped according to his Command. The Mountain of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> repreſents the falſe worſhipping of God: for although there might be ſomething done there, that God had required in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worſhip to be done, yet they mixing other things with it that God had not required to be done in his Worſhip; and ſo it repreſents all falſe outward forms of Worſhip. And Jeſus tells the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152785:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> woman, and would have her believe him, (mark that) Jeſus would have the woman belleve him, that <hi>the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain,</hi> (that is, in the falſe outward forms of Worſhip) <hi>nor at Jeruſalem,</hi> (that is, the true outward forms of Worſhip) <hi>they ſhould worſhip the Father. But the hour cometh, and now is,</hi> (mark that, <hi>now is,</hi> then at that time it was) <hi>that the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth:</hi> and that becauſe <hi>the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. God being a ſpirit, they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> or elſe it is no worſhipping of him, where the Spirit and the Truth is wanting, becauſe whom God ſeeketh to worſhip him, they and they onely are the acceptable Worſhippers of God: and God ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thoſe and onely thoſe to worſhip him, that worſhip him in ſpirit and truth. It is not the outward places, nor the outward form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (no not at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor the outward Worſhip comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be uſed there) that God ſeeketh for; it is the ſpiritual Worſhip done in the truth and in the ſincerity of the heart, that God ſeeketh for; it is that and that onely that is well-pleaſing to him, which the outward forms of worſhipping is not, although never ſo exactly performed according to the Command of God, yet if the Spirit of God, which leads and guides into all truth, be wanting, the outward form is not acceptable to God, nor ſought for of God, nor deſired of God. And where the Spirit of God is, and is the Guide and Leader of them in his Worſhip, although the outward form be wanting, yet theſe are the true Worſhippers of God; and theſe are thoſe that God ſeeketh for to worſhip him, that is, thoſe that worſhip him in his Spirit and in his Truth, that is, in Jeſus; and all thoſe that ſo worſhip him in the uſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms, or without the uſe of outward forms. Of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Kinreds, and People, and Tongues, that worſhip him in his Spirit and in his Truth, in Jeſus which ſaves from ſin, by which Spirit they are guided and led thereunto to do it in the truth and ſincerity of their hearts, theſe are ſuch as God ſeeketh for to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and are acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>And of theſe <hi>John</hi> beheld the great multitude that no man could number, ſtanding before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their hands, crying with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Salvation to our God: which came out of great tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, having waſhed their robes, and made them white in the bloud of the Lamb.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> did but hear of a hundred forty and four
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152785:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> thouſand of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be ſealed for the ſervants of God. And thoſe were they that were in the outward form of Worſhip, which had the Commandments writ in Tables of ſtone, and had the Law and the Prophets written in Books without them, and read among them, without them, every Sabbath-day. And had the Oracles of God committed to them? <hi>and to whom pertain the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes: Whoſe are the Fathers, and of whom concerning the fleſh Chriſt came.</hi> And yet of all the Tribes of the outward <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was but a hundred forty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſealed for the ſervants of God.</p>
            <p>I take notice, and ſo I deſire the Reader to take notice, that the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> was left out; there was none ſealed of that Tribe (that was a Serpent by the way) to be the ſervants of God; none of the ſubtile Serpents Tribe are ſealed to be the ſervants of God: And that was the reaſon why there was no more ſealed of all the outward Tribes of outward <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Serpents Tribe was not ſealed; and the Serpents Tribe is thoſe wherein the Serpent and his ſeed rule in the heart. Theſe being left out, and not ſealed for the ſervants of God of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there was no more ſealed; and it is the reaſon that there is no more ſealed of all the Tribes that are in the ſeveral outward forms of outward Worſhip: and that is that which makes their number ſo ſmall that a man may eaſily number a hundred forty and four thouſand.</p>
            <p>And of the Gentiles, all Nations, and Kinreds, and People, and Tongues, that have not known the ſubtilty of the Serpent tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man in the outward forms of worſhipping of God; and alſo of thoſe that have known the ſubtilty of the Serpent tempting them in outward forms of worſhipping of God; and have known a ſaving and being delivered out of thoſe temptations of the Serpent by the life of Jeſus in them, (and ſo are none of the Serpents by the life of Jeſus in them, (and ſo are none of the Serpents Tribe) nor are ſufficing themſelves, nor can ſuffice themſelves in that they are worſhipping God in outward forms, but are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping him in his Spirit and in his Truth, that is, in Jeſus that ſaves them from ſin. Of all theſe, that is, of thoſe that have not known the ſubtilty of the Serpent tempting them in outward forms; and thoſe that have known the ſubtilty of the Serpent tempting them in outward forms, and have known a being ſaved and delivered out of his temptations. There are <hi>a great multitude,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152785:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> that no man can number, ſtanding before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands, crying with a loud voice, ſaying, Salvation to our God, having come out of great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, and waſhed their robes, and made them white in the bloud of the Lamb.</hi> Thus Jeſus is a Light and a Saviour to thoſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear of that Jeſus born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to return again to thoſe that have heard of that Jeſus born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, and have known ſomething of the working of Gods Spirit in them, and have known ſomething what it hath been to be drawn or led forth by the Spirit of Jeſus in them: how far they may go, and yet not know the birth of the Child Jeſus in them, that ſaves from ſin, nor the woman that was deceived and in the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be ſaved out of the tranſgreſſion by bearing the Child Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Man may by Jeſus, the Light in him, be convinced of ſin, that it is the breaking of Gods Command, and of the Judgment of God that is due to man for ſin, and he may be ſo far convinced in himſelf of ſin, and of Gods judgment for ſin, as that he may be brought to a repentance and ſorrow for his ſins, and a deſire to be kept from ſinning, and he may pray earneſtly that he may be kept from ſin, and may ſet upon a reformation, and do many things in obedience to God, that he knew to be the will of God: And this may be done from ſome ſtirrings or movings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus in him, and yet the Serpent ſelf his own will deceive him in all this, as I have experienced.</p>
            <p>And that thus man may from the knowledge that he hath of this or that thing, that he does know that in the doing thereof he doth that which is a breaking of the Command of God; and for his ſo breaking of the Command of God, Jeſus, the Light in him that makes known to him the breaking of Gods Command, doth likewiſe make known to him what is due to him for his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, that is, Death, Hell, or Damnation; which man being afraid of, and willing to eſcape, and to eſcape the puniſhment that he apprehends to be due to him for his ſins, this makes him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his ſins, and not onely to ſay lightly and careleſly, as many do, <hi>I would I had not ſinned, and broken Gods Commands, and God forgive me for it;</hi> but there is in them an inward repentance, an inward ſorrow and grief which goes ſo far as that there is a deſire in them that they may not commit ſin again, and an earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152785:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> to God that they may not commit ſin again; and a doing of many things to prevent or to be kept from the doing or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſin again, which they have before committed. And yet in all this the ſubtile Serpents ſelf, or mans will, prevails much, as I have experienced.</p>
            <p>That man may repent that he hath ſinned in doing what he knew to be a breaking of Gods Command, and may be ſorrowful for it, and mourn for it, and earneſtly pray that he may do ſo no more, and uſe much means to be kept from ſinning, and yet all this time hath a love to the ſin; but for fear that he hath of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the willingneſs that he hath to eſcape the puniſhment, cauſeth the repentance, and ſorrow, and mourning that he hath for ſinning: and to eſcape the puniſhment, that ſets him upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as praying, faſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other religious Duties, that he thinks may be a means to keep him from being overcome by the Devils temptations, and to do ſuch things as he thinks God will be pleaſed with; and for this his ſo doing of theſe things, he thinks to find acceptance with God. And all this may be done for a ſelf-end, and in their own will, and is onely to eſcape the puniſhment; which if they could eſcape the puniſhment, the doing the things that God hath forbidden, would be no trouble to them, but very pleaſing, and to be deſired. And in this ſtate many are deceived, and think themſelves in a good condition, becauſe they cannot now ſin as once they could, when they had little trouble in their Conſciences for their ſins; but now if they ſin, trouble, ſorrow, and grief does attend them for their ſins, and there is praying to God for forgiveneſs, and it may be private days of faſting to be kept, that they may be kept from ſinning, and it may be for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſins, ſuch ſins as none but God and their Conſcience can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of; and the beſt that they know of outward forms of Religion, is ſet up and ſtrictly practiſed by them; and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blameleſs life is got up in them, to what they once lived in: and they are counted of others to be one of thoſe that are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven; and they look upon themſelves to be one of that number: And yet all this time the root of ſin, that is, the love of ſin remains in them as live as ever it was; and ſo long as the love of any ſin remains alive in them, what they do in obedience to God, is done becauſe they are afraid of Gods Juſtice for their ſin; and while there remains in them a fear of Gods Juſtice for ſin, they have no true love to God,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152785:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> while they are afraid of God. <hi>There is no fear in love, perfect love caſteth out fear,</hi> 1 John 4. 18. Their repentings, ſorrows, griefs, mournings, prayings, faſtings, and all other their religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, while done for the eſcaping, or for the preventing Gods Juſtice to fall upon them, becauſe of their ſins that they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. That which carries them forth to the doing and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe repentings, ſorrows, griefs, mournings, prayings, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, and all other their religious performances, it is ſelf, it is for a ſelf-end to eſcape or prevent Gods Juſtice falling on them for their ſins; and therefore it is that they will do them: And ſo they are deceived in all their doings, by the ſubtilty of ſelf in them, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own wills in them, and are of the Serp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe they have known the beginning of <hi>John,</hi> preaching in the Wilderneſs in them, that is, when their hearts were as a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, wherein every unclean Beaſt fed and found an abiding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, every unclean Luſt found wherewithal to feed upon, and to abide in. Before man diſobeyed God in eating of the Tree that God had forbidden him to eat of, mans heart was like a garden, a place of Gods delight, and brought forth pleaſing Fruit unto God; the Plants therein were of Gods planting, no Thorns nor Thiſtles were therein, nor no wild nor unclean Beaſt was found there; but after man had diſobeyed God in eating of the Tree that God had forbidden him to eat of, then mans heart, inſtead of being like a garden wherein God was pleaſed, it became like a Wilderneſs, a place diſpleaſing to God, a place wherein God was offended, a place bringing forth Thorns and Thiſtles; ſuch Plants of diſobedience ſprung up in the heart of man as was not of Gods planting, nor pleaſing to God: And then mans heart became like a Wilderneſs, a place of every unclean and beaſtly Luſt to harbour, feed, and abide in. And here in this wilderneſs of the heart many have heard the voice of <hi>John,</hi> the Forerunner of Jeſus, preaching Repentance; and they having heard his voice, and have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and have come to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, that is, an outward waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water, a making clean of the outſide, and ſo they have been <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, they have known a cutting of the Branches of ſin, that is, a repenting and forſaking ſuch ſins and evils as are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accounted as ſin and evil. Yea, they may have gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have cut down the body of ſin, that is, they have not onely repented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd forſaken ſuch ſins and evils as are done out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152785:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> that man can accuſe them of, but have repented and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken ſuch ſins done within them, that none can accuſe them of but God and their Conſciences; and yet they have not come ſo far as to hear and obey the end of <hi>John</hi>'s preaching in them, that is, that the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree of ſin; and the root from whence ſin ſprung is love, that is, the love that is in mans heart to ſin, the love to the ſin that is firſt in mans heart, before it cometh forth into action. There was firſt in the woman a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tree to be good for food, and pleaſing to the eye, and a deſire to it; this was firſt in her, before ſhe took of the fruit thereof and eat of it: There is firſt in the heart of man a love to ſin, before there is a going forth to the committing of it; and this love is the root from whence ſin in the action ſprung. And the end of <hi>John</hi>'s preaching was to lay the Ax to the root of the Tree ſin, which bringeth not forth good fruit, to hew it down and caſt it into the fire to be conſumed, that is, to caſt the love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſin that is in the heart of man, to caſt that into the fire to be conſumed that gave the firſt being to ſin in man, which was love in the will and in the deſire of man.</p>
            <p>And although we read of many that heard <hi>John</hi> preach Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and came to his Baptiſm, as did <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Regions round about <hi>Jordan,</hi> many Phariſees and Scribes were baptiſed of him, confeſſing their ſins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. yet few of them came to the end of his preaching, to know the Ax laid to the root of the Tree, to know the love and deſire to ſin in the heart, to be hewn down and caſt into the fire to be conſumed. And this <hi>John</hi> told them, muſt be in the Baptiſm of Jeſus (which his Baptiſm was a forerunner of) which was to baptiſe with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire. In Jeſus's Baptiſm, in the Baptiſm that ſaves from ſin, they were to know the fire of the Holy Ghoſt to burn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the love and deſire to ſin in them. That whereas there was a time in which they had in them a love and a deſire to commit ſin, but dare not commit ſin for fear of the puniſhment that they knew was juſtly due to them for their ſins; but if they could have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the puniſhment, they would willingly have pleaſed themſelves in the ſins. And here the Serpent ſelf deceived them; they thought there was an enmity in them againſt ſin, becauſe they were afraid to commit ſin, when the enmity was not againſt ſin, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the puniſhment for ſin. And ſo indeed and in truth, the enmity that they thought was in them againſt ſin, it was in them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152785:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> againſt God, that is againſt the juſtice of God, and ſin in the root, ſin in the love and the deſire to it was alive, and ſin and they in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and thus the ſubtile Serpents ſelf and their own wills de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them under a form of godlineſs.</p>
            <p>But when they are come to the end of <hi>Johns</hi> Preaching and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and know what it is to have the axe laid to the root of the tree of ſin, to the love of ſin, and to know the hewing down and burning up of the love and deſire to ſin in them, ſo as if there were no puniſhment for ſin, yet would they not ſin: And why would they not ſin? it is becauſe of the manifeſtations or making known of the love of God that is ſhed abroad in the heart, God having made known the freeneſs of his love to them, without any deſert from them, that while they were ſinners, and ſo enemies to God, there was love in God to them, and he ſent his Son to die to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to himſelf: This begets a love in them to God, we love him becauſe he firſt loved us; and now the enmity is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the puniſhment (as it was when what we did in obedience to God, was becauſe we were afraid of Hell if we diſobeyed him) but the enmity is now againſt the ſin, as it offends that God that hath beſtowed the riches of his Love upon them: And now the Creature if it be drawn aſide by the temptations of his own hearts luſts (if the Serpent bruiſe the heel of the ſeed of the Woman in it, as God hath ſaid it ſhould) how does it mourn for its offence! not becauſe it knows that God as a loving Father will chaſtize it for its offence; it does well know that God will not let offences paſs in his Children unchaſtized, but their grief and ſorrow is, becauſe it hath offended God his loving Father: And as to the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, although in themſelves they are tedious, but as they come from a loving Father, and are for their good, ſo they are pleaſing to them, as God makes uſe of them to the bringing forth of the peaceable fruit of Righteouſneſs in them: This was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 67. Before he was afflicted he went aſtray, but now he had kept his word; and hence is a change wrought in the heart: now the ſorrow and grief that is in it becauſe ſin is committed, is not becauſe it is afraid of the puniſhment, as once it was, but the ſorrow and grief is becauſe a loving God, a loving Father is offended by its breaking of his Commands.</p>
            <p>And this change in the heart is wrought by the joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the two ſeeds (if I may ſo call them) the ſeed of God the power of God in man, and the ſeed of God the power of God
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152785:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> without man; and from hence cometh the Child Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, in the bearing of which the woman was ſaved: That in man that was deceived and in the tranſgreſſion, is again ſaved; here cometh the reſtauration of man, man being reſtored again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Image of love to God that he loſt in the fall, and into that Image of holineſs in obeying God that he loſt in the fall; and now there is a change wrought in the will, man being brought to will what God will, and that becauſe it is Gods will; and now he does not do Gods will, becauſe he knows that if he does it not he ſhall be puniſhed for his tranſgreſſions, as once he did when that which put him upon his obedience to God, in what he knew to be Gods will that he ſhould do; it was that by the doing thereof he might eſcape that puniſhment that he knew would be due to him if he did not do Gods will: but now there is ſuch a change, that if there were no puniſhment for the tranſgreſſion, yet there is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs in him to do Gods will, and that becauſe of the love that God hath manifeſted and made known to him, that God loved him when there was an enmity in his heart againſt God, yet God loved him, and ſent his Son to die to reconcile him to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10. And this begot ſuch a love in the heart to God, as that it ſo changes the will, that its deſire is not to do its own will, but Gods will onely; and it is afraid leſt its own will, that he is ſo much ſenſible of that hath ſo much deceived him, ſhould get into the doing of what he is ſo carried forth to do in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and ſo deceive him and bring him again into the tranſgreſſion, that he is afraid of his own will as of a deadly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: this is known in ſome meaſure, degree, or other where the Child Jeſus is born, and the Woman ſaved out of the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they do know the work of the onely begotten Son of God in them, and not only to reſtore that in them that <hi>Adam</hi> loſt in the fall, but to preſerve and keep them from falling by the temptation as <hi>Adam</hi> did; they knew that in them that the Serpent cannot tempt ſo as to cauſe it to ſin, nor never did, nor never will yield to the temptation; and that they are not onely the created Sons of God, but the begotten Sons of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 23. and that it is that begotten Son of God in them that keeps them from falling by the temptation.</p>

And inſtead of loving the Light that makes known evil deeds in them, they hate the Light, becauſe it diſcovers, lays open, and makes their evil deeds known, and reproves them for evil deeds; and therefore they will not come to the Light, but hate it. The Light in them calls them to come and believe in it, but they will not come and believe in it: And why will they not come and believe in it? It is becauſe they love their evil deeds, and that cauſes them to hate the Light; but he that doth truth, that is, he that in ſincerity and integrity of his heart, doth the things that God hath made known in him to be his will that he ſhould obey him in, he cometh to the Light: And why doth he that doth truth, come to the Light? It is, that his deeds, his works may be made known, made manifeſt that they are wrought in God. He that doth truth, he that truly yields obedience to God, according to what he knows of God, his hearts deſire is to bring all his actions and deeds to Jeſus the true Light of God in him, that thereby they may be made known, made manifeſt, made truly known in him, and to him, that they are the works of God wrought in him, that is the great thing deſired by him that doth the truth, to know that all that is done in him, is done by Jeſus the truth in him.</p>
            <p>So that the difference that is made in men, is of their own making. Gods love is general to all; he ſent his Son to ſave all that would believe in him; he hath made known his love in all. That which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them; God

Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things that are not convenient,</hi> Rom. 1. 21, 28. I pray mark the words of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: <hi>Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,</hi> (which knowledge they once had that God had given to them of himſelf) <hi>God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things that are not convenient.

It is, becauſe they do not like to retain, to keep that knowledge that God hath given to them of himſelf, and to keep it ſo as to glorifie him in that knowledge; and ſo to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him in that knowledge, as thereby to manifeſt their thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, and to manifeſt their thankfulneſs by their obedience, in obeying God according to what they know of him. And the want of this their obeying God according to what God hath made known of himſelf unto them, is the cauſe why even, juſt alike God gives men over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things that are not convenient; and as they are Reprobates, ſo they are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Others that do the truth, they obey God in Jeſus the truth, and their hearts deſire is, that Jeſus the true Light may make known the truth in them and to them, that their deeds are wrought in God; and they are lovers of the Light, and from that love that they have to the Light, and to the doing the truth, that is, the doing of the will of God in ſincerity and integrity of their hearts, according as Jeſus the true Light in them, hath made known in them what is Gods will that they ſhould do, and what is Gods will that they ſhould not do. Theſe they bring their deeds to the Light, that they may be made manifeſt, that is, made known in them, and to them that they are wrought by God in them.</p>
            <p>Gods love is ſuch to man, in general to all men, as that he is willing to keep man from periſhing, and is willing to ſave them,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152785:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> and give them eternal life. But ſome men are not willing to come to Jeſus the true Light in them, although God ſo loved the world <hi>Man,</hi> as to ſend him to that end, that whoſoever believed on him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life; yet Jeſus the true Light, ſaid to ſome that thought to have eternal life in the Scriptures, and it was to thoſe that were in the higheſt outward form of worſhipping. God, and ſaid God was their Father, to theſe Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life,</hi> John 5. 39, 40. Mans will is that which hinders man from coming to Jeſus the true Light, that they may have life, that they may be ſaved by him. God does his part in ſending his Son into the World to ſave them; and ſo the Father draws them by the Son, and he is the true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the World, he makes known Gods love in them and to them; and ſo the Father draws them by making known his love in them. Can any one ſay, that they have known the Father to draw them to come to the Son to believe on him, any other way but as Jeſus the Son, the true Light in them hath made known the Fathers love to them? And this God hath done to all, becauſe that which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them, God hath ſhewed it unto them. The inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World, <hi>are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</hi> (Mark that!) <hi>Even his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal power and Godhead.</hi> And what is there more to be known of God, than <hi>his eternal power and Godhead?</hi> Dare any one ſay, that they know any thing more of God than what is contained in <hi>his eternal power and Godhead?</hi> And although God hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf in them, and ſhewed himſelf to them, yet they will not come to his beloved Son Jeſus, the true Light, that they may have life. Jeſus did not ſay to them, the ſubtle Serpent, Satan, the Tempter, or the Devil, that they would not have them come to him that they might have life; but it was their will that hindered or kept them back from coming to Jeſus that they might have life. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</hi> Oh, Will! Will! that which brought man into ſin, and ſo brought death; that keeps man from coming to Jeſus the true Light, that they may again have life.</p>

               <p>TO have the will brought to be reſigned up into Gods will, to be given up into the will of God, to be what God will; this is the taking up of the Croſs, and following of Jeſus; this is to be a Diſciple of Jeſus: this is to learn of Jeſus, and without this, whatſoever outward profeſſion any may be of, how zealous ſoever they may be in that outward profeſſion, how outwardly blameleſs ſoever they may live, how much ſoever they may be eſteemed of by others, how high eſteem ſoever they may have of themſelves, as to be the Diſciples, the Scholars, or Learners of Jeſus; yet if they have not learned ſome part of this Leſſon, to deny themſelves, to deny all that is of ſelf in them, which the will is a great part of, and take up his Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Jeſus. The Croſs that Jeſus took up, was the Croſs to that will in him, that as he was man would have had the Cup taken from him, but he took up the Croſs to that will in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Father, not my will, but thy will be done;</hi> and this Croſs muſt all take up that will be his Diſciples, that will learn of him, and follow him in the ſpirit, and not be knowers of him in the fleſh, and followers of him onely in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Jeſus ſaid to his Diſciples, that if any man will come after him, and whoſoever will come after him muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily and follow him, <hi>Matth. 16. 24. Mark 8. 24. Luke</hi> 9. 23. I pray mark the words of the Scripture, if any man will, or whoſoever will, which is as much as to ſay, there is none whoſoever that can come after Jeſus, there is none whoſoever that can follow Jeſus, there is none whoſoever that can learn of Jeſus, but they muſt firſt deny themſelves, deny all that is of ſelf in them, which will is a great part of. All that is of ſelf is firſt to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before man can take up his Croſs and follow Jeſus: before man can take up a Croſs to his own will, his own will muſt firſt be denyed, be ſaid Nay to, be reſiſted as being of the Devil; <hi>Reſiſt the Devil and he will flee from you,</hi> Jam. 4. 7.

               <p>And ſo it will be with us and in us, if we will with the Light of Jeſus in us, that light that is in us, and it is ſo in us that it would ſave us from ſin, ſave us from the doing of our own wills, if we would by the help and aſſiſtance of the power of that Jeſus, the Light in us, reſiſt the temptations of the will, and abide in the power of that Light, Jeſus, believe in his Name, believe in that power which is the love of God to us; it is the Goſpel of God, the good tidings of God, the power of God to Salvation, which is made known in us. If we will believe in the name of this Jeſus, the true Light, believe in the power of the Light in us, that that Light, that power of God, that Goſpel, that making known of Gods love to us, and <hi>in</hi> us, that it is that and that onely that is able to ſave us, is able to keep us to ſalvation; and ſo by it to be ſaved from the temptations of our own wills. This will ſave us from the temptations of our own wills, and ſo ſave us from the condemnation that is due to us for our ſins which we commit in yielding to our own wills: The believing in the name of the onely begotten Son of God, in the power of the true Light in us, which is the onely begotten Son of God, which all thoſe that do not believe in the name of this true Light in them, in the power of that Light in them, which is the onely begotten Son of God, they are already condemned; they are (while they are out of that believing in the name of the onely begotten Son of God) in the preſent ſtate of condemnation for their ſins, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. and are in the doing of their own wills, and ſo are not in the taking up of the Croſs, which is not onely to be taken up, that is to ſay, once and no more, or now and then, as for a man once to ſay he took up his Croſs, he croſſed, he ſaid Nay, to his own will, he once vanquiſhed, he once overcame his own will, he once fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Jeſus; or to ſay ſometimes, he took up his Croſs, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times croſſed his own will, he ſometimes vanquiſhed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

As Jeſus taught his Diſciples to pray day by day for their daily bread, ſo they are to pray day by day, <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven:</hi> They are day by day to pray that Gods will be done, in their earthy bodies, day by day to take up their Croſs and follow Jeſus; day by day, every day daily Jeſus took up the Croſs to his will as man, he ſaid Nay to that will that was in him as man, he vanquiſhed and overcame that will he had as man, and day by day daily he did the will of the Father, as he was the onely begotten Son of the Father; and if any man, and whoſoever will come after him, will follow him, he muſt take up his Croſs to his will, he muſt croſs his will, he muſt ſay Nay to his will, he muſt vanquiſh and overcome his will, and this muſt not be done onely once, or at ſome times, but daily, conſtantly, day by day, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and that is to take up the Croſs and follow Jeſus, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which ſaves from ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is to be a Scholar, a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that Light Jeſus in us, that is in us, and it is a gift of God given unto us, and that to that very end, to ſave us from ſin, to ſave us from the doing of our own wills, and to reſtore us to the doing of Gods will, and to keep us in the doing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, as the begotten Son of God, and not as the created ſon of God who fell from the doing of Gods will, although made in Gods Image, which the begotten Son of God cannot fall from the doing of Gods will; he ſinneth not, nor can he ſin, becauſe the ſeed of God remains in him, abides in him; and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God. That which is born of God cannot ſin, and whoſoever does not bear his Croſs and come to Jeſus, follow Jeſus, cannot be his Diſciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 27. There is no being a Diſciple, a Scholar, a Learner of Jeſus, without bearing of his Croſs, without coming to Jeſus; without following of Jeſus none can be his Diſciple: but they may be the Diſciples and Followers of Jeſus, and yet not follow thoſe that look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves to be the Diſciples and Followers of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The Twelve forbade one caſting out Devils in Jeſus Name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not follow them, but Jeſus rebuked them for it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Forbid him not; for he that is not againſt us, is for us; and none could do miracles in his name, and lightly ſpeak evil of him,</hi> Mark 9. 38.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152785:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> 39, 40. He that caſteth out Devils in himſelf, he that takes up the Croſs to his own will, he is a Follower of Jeſus, a Diſciple, a Scholar, a Learner of Jeſus within him, that ſaves him from ſin, as was he that the Twelve met with that caſt out Devils in Jeſus name, in the power of Jeſus in him; and yet the Twelve forbade him to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name, in the power of Jeſus, becauſe he followed not them, he gave not honour to them, to follow them, to come after them, and therefore it was that they did not regard that he was a follower of Jeſus, and that he was for Jeſus, and did miracles in his Name; they regarded more their own honour to be followed by him, than they minded the honour of Jeſus, who he honoured and followed, and was for Jeſus, and yet they forbade him to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name who was on Jeſus part, and could not lightly, eaſily, readily ſpeak evil of Jeſus; and yet in their own wills for a ſelf-end of their own, becauſe he followed not them, gave not them the honour, they forbade him to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name; and ſuch a one I have known forbidden to declare to others what God hath made known to him, that ſo as an inſtrument in Gods hand he might be as a means to caſt out the Devils that entred into man by the ſubtilty of the Serpents ſelf in man, in and by declaring to others Gods goodneſs to him, how God hath made known the ſubtile Serpent to him, and how he hath known God to caſt out the ſubtile Serpent that ruled in him in an outward form and ſhew of godlineſs, and ſuch a one I have known forbidden to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to others Gods goodneſs to him, and forbidden by thoſe that have profeſſed that they have been ſent of Jeſus to caſt out Devils as was the Twelve; and why? becauſe he followed not them, he gave not them the honour they deſired and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>But he or they, let them be who they will, that does not take up his Croſs and follow Jeſus, is not worthy of him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 38. Where the Croſs to mans own will is not taken up, where all that is of man is not denyed, where mans will is not become a nothing, and no will known but what is reſigned and given up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of God; where there is a love to any thing more than to Jeſus, a love to any thing more than to that which ſaves from ſin, let them have never ſo near, never ſo much familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with an outward Jeſus, as the Twelve had with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man Jeſus, who met with one caſting out Devils in Jeſus
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152785:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> Name, in Jeſus power, or the power of Jeſus in him, and they forbade him, becauſe he did not follow them, what are they the better for their familiar acquaintance with the outward man Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? Did that make them worthy of the inward man Jeſus? and was he any thing at all the leſs a follower of Jeſus, the leſs a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of that which ſaveth from ſin, the leſs worthy of the inward man Jeſus, becauſe they forbade him to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name, in Jeſus power? and were not they the leſs the followers of Jeſus, for forbidding of him to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name and that becauſe he did not follow them? When they forbade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name, and that becauſe he did not follow them, had they then taken up the Croſs to their own wills, and in the bearing thereof followed Jeſus, and learned that leſſon of Jeſus, to be meek and lowly in themſelves? And if they had learned that leſſon of Jeſus, to be meek and lowly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, could ſelf their own wills have gotten to be ſo high in them, as to forbid one to caſt out Devili in Jeſus Name, and one that was for Jeſus, and could not lightly have ſpoken evil of Jeſus, and forbid him to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he followed not them, he gave not them the honour that they expected? And if they had known the Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus within them, could they in that knowledge have forbidden one to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name, becauſe he gave not them the honour of following of them?</p>
               <p>They the Twelve then had a knowledge of Jeſus, and had the moſt neareſt and moſt familiar acquaintance with Jeſus, but was it any more than a knowing of Jeſus after the fleſh? They did not know, they did not believe in his Death and Reſurrection, as the Scriptures do plainly in many places teſtifie when Jeſus ſpake of his going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to ſuffer, <hi>Peter</hi> rebuked him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21, 22. And when <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> out of whom Jeſus had caſt ſeven Devils, told them that he was riſen, and ſhe had ſeen him, they did not believe her; and after that he appeared to two more, and they told the reſt that he was riſen, and they believed them not; and then he appeared to the Eleven, and upbraided them for their unbelief, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. And ſeveral other places of Scripture there is to the ſame purpoſe, that although in the time of Jeſus being with them in the fleſh, and of that familiar acquaintance they had with him, and that power that he had given them of caſting out of Devils, yet they were then knowers of him in the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152785:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> fleſh, and followers of him in the fleſh, and they did not know him in his Death and Reſurrection in themſelves, and ſo they had not, denyed themſelves, denied their own wills, and taken up their Croſs to all that was of ſelf, their own wills in them; and from thence it came that they ſeeing one caſting out Devils in Jeſus Name: and becauſe he follow'd not them, that was the very ground and reaſon why they forbade him, it was becauſe he followed not them; and they in forbidding of him did not follow Jeſus, becauſe they had not taken up the Croſs to their own wills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid true in what he ſaid, that <hi>there is nothing new,</hi> what it was, and what it was, is; ſo that now it is from the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and familiar acquaintance that ſome now have of Jeſus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, and in the knowledge and acquaintance with him he hath ſent them forth, and given the power to caſt out Devils; and they, as the Twelve did, meeting one caſting out Devils in Jeſus Name, they forbid him, and that becauſe he followed not them; and thoſe that do ſo, they are in the ſtate the Twelve were in, they knew not the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus: But where the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus is known, and the Croſs is taken up to their own wills, to all that is of ſelf in them, they will be of <hi>Pauls</hi> mind, <hi>Some indeed preach Chriſt even of envie and ſtrife, and ſome alſo of good will; the one preacheth Chriſt of contention, not ſincerely, ſuppoſing to add afflictions to my bonds, but the other of love, knowing that I am ſet for the defence of the Goſpel: What then? not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Chriſt is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and I therein do rejoyce yea, and I mill rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 1. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this Scripure it is plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> had learned that leſſon of ſelf-denial, had taken up the Croſs to his own will, and did follow Jeſus, knowing the power of his Death and Reſurrection in him, and that made him rejoyce, yea, and he would rejoyce in that Chriſt was preached every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, although the pretenders of preaching Chriſt, preaching him out of envy and ſtrife, and not ſincerely thinking thereby to add affliction to his bonds, yet he rejoyced and would rejoyce in that Chriſt was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: This was a great way diſtant and differing from the Twelve, forbidding one to caſt out Devils in Jeſus Name, and that becauſe he did not follow them.</p>
               <p>When Jeſus comes to be leſs known and followed in the fleſh, and more known and followed in the ſpirit, then there will be a time, that as every man hath received the gift, even ſo to miniſter
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152785:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſame one to another as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God, <hi>if any man ſpeak let him ſpeak as the Oracle of God;</hi> if any man miniſter let him do it as the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be praiſe and dominion for ever Amen, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. Such a time as this I believe will come, although through my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward age I may not live in the body to ſee it, yet now I do ſee it by the eye of faith; and if I depart this life before that day come, I ſhall die in the belief of it, That there ſhall be a time when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall be leſs known, and leſs followed in the fleſh than he is now, and more known and followed in the Spirit than now he is. And that there ſhall not be ſo much Lordſhip and power uſed over one another as now there is amongſt thoſe that are the diſciples of Chriſt, and know him and follow him after the fleſh, which had its being when the Twelve met one caſting out Devils in Jeſus Name, and forbade him becauſe he followed not them; but there ſhall be a true following of Jeſus and obeying his command in thoſe that are great among them, in that they will not do as the Kings of the Gentiles did exerciſe Lordſhip one over another, but he that is great among them ſhall be as the younger, and he that is chief as he that doth ſerve, and that is to be like Jeſus, who was amongſt his Diſciples as he that ſerveth, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25, 26, 27. When this day comes the high places will be taken down within and alſo without, what high places were there either within or without for men to get up in when the Apoſtles and others firſt preached the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus? and the power of God went forth then wonderfully in reaching the witneſs of God in them that heard them, although their words were not many. And what high places were there either within or without for men to get up in, when thoſe called Quakers came firſt forth like poor ſilly men, and here and there ſpake a few words as they met with people. And how then went the power of God forth with them reaching the witneſs of God in many that went to ſee what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men they were? as my ſelf was one.</p>
               <p>I believe there will come a time when the Diſciples, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Jeſus ſhall know what it was that Jeſus did when he waſhed his Diſciples feet, which <hi>Peter</hi> when he did it did not know what he did, and yet <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw him waſh and wipe the outward feet of ſome before he came to him to waſh his feet. And <hi>Peter</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it but onely as an outward act, and ſaw not then the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152785:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpiritual meaning of it, but looking upon it as an outward act, he thought it was not a ſitting thing for Jeſus, his Lord and Maſter, to waſh his feet; but Jeſus tells them, that although he was their Lord and Maſter, he had waſhed their feet, and he did it to that very end, to give them an Example that they ſhould do to others as he had done to them, and that it was a duty that they ought to waſh one anothers feet, <hi>John</hi> 13. When and where this duty is practiſed, there all Lordly and Maſterly power is caſt down, there is no exerciſing of authority over others, there is a knowing what it is to take up the Croſs to their own Wills, and to follow the Example of Jeſus. Which waſhing of feet was another thing than the waſhing of the outward feet: for although <hi>Peter</hi> then had ſo much outward familiar acquaintance with Jeſus in the fleſh, yet he knew not the meaning of it, although he had been ſent forth by Jeſus to preach and caſt out Devils, (as others now may be) but <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould know afterwards the meaning of it. And <hi>Peter</hi> did afterwards know the meaning of it, when he knew the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus, which then he did not know nor believe the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus, when Jeſus waſhed the outward feet of his Diſciples. But when <hi>Peter</hi> came to that knowledge that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 16. Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh: yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet henceforth know we him no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When and where this knowledge is of knowing no man after the fleſh, not the knowing of Chriſt after the fleſh, there is the knowing what it is to waſh one anothers feet; which <hi>Peter</hi> did not know, while he knew Chriſt after the fleſh; which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge cannot be meant the outward feet being waſhed, for then <hi>Peter</hi> would have known what Jeſus had done when he waſhed the Diſciples outward feet; but it was the waſhing of thoſe feet, which if Jeſus did not do for them, they had no part in him: And then <hi>Peter</hi> who had before denied Jeſus to waſh his feet, now ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he would loſe his part in him, would have not onely his feet waſhed, but his hands and his head; but Jeſus told him, he that is waſhed needeth not ſave to waſh his feet, but is clear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit; that is, the feet that is the duty of the Diſciples, the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Jeſus, that they are to be as Inſtruments in Gods hand to waſh one for another; it is that or thoſe feet that makes them clean every whit. That part of the body that God had ſaid the Serpent ſhould bruiſe, that part Jeſus waſht, and left it as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152785:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Command for his Diſciples to follow; read it in the Myſtery who can.</p>
               <p>The feet is that upon which the whole body is born up, they are thoſe upon which the body walks, they are next the Earth; theſe being waſhed and made clean, the whole body is clean, and ſo they repreſent or figure mans walking in obedience to God; which as an Inſtrument in Gods hand, the new Creature in us moves and walks upon the feet of obedience in us; which if our obedience be not waſhed and made clean by Jeſus, we can have no part in Jeſus; that is, if what we do in obedience to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Command of God, be not the work of Jeſus in us, we have no part in Jeſus. And man being waſhed and made clean in that part of him, that is, in his walking in obedience to God, by Jeſus who is the life of the new Creature in man, he need not have any more waſhed or made clean, but is clean every whit. Man in this his walking in obedience to God, he treads upon the earthy part in him, which is very ready to cleave to the feet of his walking in obedience to God; and ſo to defile them, the Serpent God hath ſaid, ſhall bruiſe the heel of the ſeed of the woman, hurt or hinder Jeſus in the pure operation or working of the Spirit of Jeſus in man: And ſo thereby the feet of mans walking in obedience to God, that which the new Creature in man, may be ſaid, as in a figure, to walk and move upon in obedience to God, as Jeſus the Life moves in the new Creature; and ſo as our obedience is from the movings and ſtirrings of the new Creature in us, which moves and walks upon the earthy part in us; and ſo as the earthy part in us cleaves to the feet of obedience in us, ſo comes the feet to be defiled and made unclean. Now as Jeſus hath waſhed and made clean the feet of obedience in any, and keeps them clean in the walking in obedience to God; it is their duty, and they are to follow the Example of Jeſus: That if they ſee in any that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent hath bruiſed the heel of the ſeed of the woman in them, that is, in their walking upon the earthy part in them, any part of the Earth hath cleaved to their feet, whereby they are polluted or defiled; then it is their duty, as Inſtruments in Gods hand, to waſh and make clean the feet of thoſe that they ſee ſo polluted or defiled.</p>
               <p>And this is what God by the Apoſtle commanded: <hi>If any man be overtaken in a fault, yea which are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering thy ſelf leſt thou alſo be tempted. Bear ye

Which is as much as to ſay, If any man by the temptation of the Serpent, hath defiled his feet of obedience in being overtaken in a fault, the earthy part on which he walked upon in his obedience, hath cleaved to his feet of obedience and hath defiled them, yea that are ſpiritual, yea that ſtand in your obedience by the power of Jeſus in you, who hath waſhed your feet; waſh ye the feet of thoſe that are polluted, reſtore ſuch a one again to the pure and clean walking in obedience to Jeſus, but do it in the ſpirit of meekneſs, in a low and meek ſpirit, not lording it over them, but in meekneſs and lowlineſs of mind, as if thou wert indeed a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to them, attending upon them to that very end; conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted, leſt thou alſo fall by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of the Serpent ſelf in thee, leſt thou pollute or defile thy feet of obedience in walking upon the earthy part in thee. And ſo then thou mayſt ſtand as much in need of another to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in Gods hand to waſh thy feet to make thee clean in thy obedience to God, and ſo reſtore thee again by the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, as thy Brother hath need of thee. And in thus your ſeeking to reſtore one another in the ſpirit of meekneſs, ye <hi>bear one anothers burthens, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt,</hi> the Command of Chriſt, to waſh one anothers feet as he waſhed your feet.</p>
               <p>And when and where this ſhall be put in practice, that Lordly power which ſome in their wills, becauſe they have known Jeſus in the fleſh, and he hath ſent them to preach and caſt out Devils, they have taken upon them to judge and condemn others wherein the Witneſs of God in their Conſciences, the Light of God, hath acquitted and cleared them: And when that Lordly power ſhall be thrown down, and a Croſs taken up to that Will, and alſo when and where this duty of waſhing one anothers feet, is known and practiſed, then when there is indeed ſuch a thing done where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the feet of obedience is polluted or defiled, and it be ſeen by thoſe in whom the Lordly and Maſterly ſpirit is caſt down, and a Croſs taken up to that Lordly and Maſterly Will in them, that was ready to run out in judging and paſſing ſentence upon others, becauſe their feet of obedience have been polluted, and by the ſubtilty of the Serpents temptations they have been overtaken in a fault: Inſtead of running upon them, and paſſing ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, there will be a Spirit of meekneſs, gentleneſs, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, love, long ſuffering, pity and compaſſion uſed to them; and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152785:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> thereby to be as Inſtruments in Gods hand to waſh the feet of ſuch a one, to recover, to reſtore, and bring ſuch a one again into obedience to God, as not knowing how ſoon you that now ſtand, may fall by the like temptations. And this I believe men will come more into the practice of, as they come to know what it is to take up the Croſs to their own Wills and to follow Jeſus, and not be like the Diſciples of Chriſt, that would have had fire to come down from Heaven upon thoſe that would not retain them, who knew not what ſpirits they themſelves were of; and yet had known Chriſt, and had followed Jeſus in the fleſh, and had preached and caſt out Devils; and yet knew not what it was for Jeſus to waſh their feet, nor what it was to waſh the feet of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and therefore had no patience to bear with them that would not retain them, that would not take in and believe what they ſaid, although ſpoken in their wills, as in their own Wills it was, that they would have fire come from Heaven to conſume them.</p>
               <p>Some there hath been in this knowing Age that we live in, that hath taken upon them to judge thoſe true words ſpoken by one whoſe life they have had nothing to object againſt; and yet for declaring what he hath known of the deceit that is wrought in the heart of man, by the ſubtilty of the Serpents ſelf in man, and that under a form of Religion, and thereby the Devil perſwades man that he ſhall thereby come to be like God; and declaring how he hath in Jeſus's Name, by the power of Jeſus the true Light in him, reſiſted and caſt out the Devil in his temptations; and deſiring them to have a care that they be not deceived by the temptations of the ſubtilty of the Serpents ſelf in them, under an outward form of Religion, and of being like God, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, and himſelf had experienced. They have judged theſe words (or words ſpoken to that purpoſe, or tending to the ſame effect, in diſcovering the ſubtilty of the Serpents ſelf in man in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of Worſhip, and how the Serpent in thoſe temptations might be reſiſted and overcome) to be ſpoken from a wrong Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo would make the Devil to be a dividing of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and ſo if Chriſts words be true, they would make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to be a throwing down his Kingdom: for he ſaid to thoſe zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Profeſſors that thought themſelves better than others, when they ſo judged of him, that he caſt out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils, that a Kingdom divided cannot ſtand: And if
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152785:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> Satan caſt out Devils, he is divided againſt himſelf; and how then can his Kingdom ſtand? <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 24, 25, 26. Jeſus himſelf meets with the like dealing from the like ſort of zealous Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. And he told his Diſciples, that <hi>the diſciple is not to be above the maſter, nor the ſervant above the lord. It is enough for the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that he be as his maſter, and the ſervant as his lord: if they have called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, how much more ſhall they call them of the houſhold?</hi> Mat. 10. 24, 25.</p>
               <p>But that which made them judge that the words were not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a true Spirit, was this (as hath been ſeveral times expreſſed by them) that is becauſe the words ſpoken they did not feel them to reach to the witneſs of God in them, or theſeed of God in them, and therefore they judged them not to be ſpoken by the true ſpirit of Jeſus in him that ſpake them, and that becauſe they found ſome thing burdened or troubled in them when thoſe words were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and yet they could not deny but that he might ſpeak what he knew to be the work of God in him, and that his words were true, and that his life was anſwerable to his words, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not feel his words to reach to the witneſs of God in them, or the Seed of God in them, but there was ſomething troubled and burden'd in them when they heard thoſe words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, therefore it was that they judged him to ſpeak theſe words by a wrong Spirit.</p>
               <p>I pray mark the Argument, becauſe the Seed of God in them, or the witneſs of God in them was not reach'd to by the words ſpoken therefore they muſt be ſpoken by a wrong Spirit; and why muſt they be ſpoken by a wrong Spirit, is becauſe ſome thing was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or burdened within them by thoſe words ſpoken: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which was troubled or burdened in them by thoſe words being ſpoken, muſt be the ſeed of God in them, or the witneſs of God in them, that muſt be the thing troubled or burdened in them by thoſe words.</p>
               <p>Oh the myſtery of deceit that lieth ſecretly hid in the heart of man by the ſubtilty of the Serpent ſelf-will in man! who will not bring their deeds to the light to be made manifeſt? who will not bring their deeds to the truth that the true Light hath made known in the Scriptures, to be thereby judged whether they be true or falſe? but do talk of a Light in them, and to walk by the Light, and yet do things and judge of things contrary to what the Scripture makes known to be true, which was given forth by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152785:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> the true Light: For by the Scriptures there is nothing more plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than that it is the duty of all to make known to others what God hath made known of himſelf to them in his great work of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of man from the ſubtilty of the Serpent, by whoſe temptation man was brought to ſin, brought to diſobey God. But this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known what God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath made known of himſelf in ſaving from ſin, this, ſay they, was ſpoken by a wrong Spirit; and the reaſon why it muſt be ſo, that it was ſpoken by a wrong Spirit, is becauſe they did not feel the words ſpoken to reach the ſeed of God, or the witneſs of God in them; and becauſe there was ſomething in them that was troubled or burdened by hearing thoſe words ſpoken, and that they ſay is the ſeed of God in them. And if they had ſaid it had been the ſeed of the Serpent in them that had been troubled, they had ſpoken more truer, and agreeable to the teſtimony of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21, 22, 23. Jeſus tells his Diſciples, <hi>that he muſt go to Jeruſalem, and ſuffer many things, and be killed, and be raiſed again the third day.</hi> What is this, but a making known to them what God the Father had made known to him that he was to do for the ſaving of man from the ſubtilty of the Serpent, who by his temptations had cauſed man to ſin? Dare any one be ſo wicked as to ſay, that Chriſt did not ſpeak this by the true Spirit, but it was a wrong Spirit in Chriſt that ſpake it? I ſay, dare any be ſo wicked as to ſay ſo? And yet theſe true words of his did not reach to the ſeed of God in <hi>Peter;</hi> and yet <hi>Peter</hi> was troubled, there was ſomething in <hi>Peter</hi> that was oppreſſed and burdened with the hearing of Jeſus ſpeaking of theſe words. And none can reaſonably believe, but that <hi>Peter</hi> thought and believed that that which was troubled and burdened by theſe words ſpoken by Jeſus, was ſomething in him that was good, ſomething in him that loved Jeſus; which <hi>Peter</hi> might, as ſome others have done, think that it was the ſeed of God in him that was troubled and burdened at what Jeſus ſpake: And that made him take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon him, as to take Jeſus to him, <hi>and began to rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this ſhall not be unto thee.</hi> And I pray what was this in <hi>Peter</hi> that was ſo troubled and burdened in <hi>Peter</hi> at what Chriſt had ſaid? Was it not <hi>Peter</hi>'s Will in him, which was contrary to Gods Will? This Will of <hi>Peter</hi>'s that was thus troubled and burdened, that lay uppermoſt in <hi>Peter,</hi> and that was that which hindered in <hi>Peter</hi> Chriſts words, that they did
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152785:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> not reach the ſeed of God in <hi>Peter:</hi> the ſubtilty of the Serpents ſelf in <hi>Peter,</hi> deceived him. He having been a Diſciple, a follower of Jeſus, and having preached the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, and had power to heal all manner of Diſeaſes, and to caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and had given that teſtimony of Jeſus that he had the words of eternal life; might not <hi>Peter,</hi> who had done all this, think that Jeſus ſpake by a wrong Spirit, becauſe he found his words to be a trouble and burden to him? <hi>Peter</hi> he did ſo think that he ſpake by a wrong Spirit, and that is plain by the Scripture: for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rebuke Jeſus for what he had ſaid, and told him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking of him, that that ſhould not be done to Jeſus, that Jeſus had ſaid ſhould be done to him. And ſo he makes Jeſus to ſpeak a lye; And what is that leſs, than to tell Jeſus that he did not ſpeak thoſe words by the true Spirit? For if <hi>Peter</hi> had believed that they had been ſpoken by a true Spirit, <hi>Peter</hi> would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the words would prove true; and he would not have gone about to reprove him for ſpeaking true words by the true Spirit: but <hi>Peter</hi> did not believe the words to be true; and going about to reprove him for ſpeaking of them, it is plain that <hi>Peter</hi> believed they were ſpoken by a wrong Spirit; when it was the lying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in <hi>Peter</hi> that reproved Jeſus for ſpeaking the truth. And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s rebuke was made up of nothing but lyes, and that made Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus call him Satan, and told him he was an offence to him: for he favoured not of the things that be of God, but thoſe things that be of men; that was, he ſavoured not the things of God, the doing Gods will which was to be done by Jeſus going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to ſuffer many things of the Elders, Chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and to be killed, and be raiſed again the third day. (See who they were that Jeſus ſuffered under; it was under thoſe that were high in an outward form of worſhipping God.) And as <hi>Peter</hi> ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the things of God, the having of Gods will done, ſo he did ſavour the things of men, he favoured the having of his own will done: for it was a will of <hi>Peter</hi>'s own which he had not taken up the Croſs to, that would not that Jeſus ſhould do what was Gods will in him that he ſhould do: And it was this will of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s that was contrary to the will of God, that was troubled and and burdened at Jeſus's words, when Jeſus ſpake the truth; and it was in that will of his own that did believe that Jeſus ſpake thoſe words by a wrong Spirit: for he made Jeſus a lyar, ſaying, that it ſhould not be as Jeſus had ſaid. And in this will, in this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152785:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> wrong Spirit, in this Satan, in this Devil, <hi>Peter</hi> undertook to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke Jeſus for ſpeaking the truth that he had received of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as to my knowledge others have done the like.</p>
               <p>And further, to make it more manifeſt that it is a lying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Spirit which worketh in the Will, that perſwades to believe that thoſe things that are true which be ſpoken, are ſpoken by a wrong Spirit; and all the reaſon that is given why it muſt be ſo, that it is ſpoken by a wrong Spirit, is becauſe it does not reach the ſeed of God in them, but they find a burden, a load oppreſſing them, and it is a great trouble to them to hear thoſe words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And if this were true, then Jeſus, in the time that he had lived upon the Earth, ſpake many times by a wrong Spirit, in that it did not reach the ſeed of God in his Diſciples. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 27 verſ. to 31 verſ. <hi>Jeſus ſaith to his Diſciples, All ye ſhall be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe of me this night: for it is written, I will ſmite the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered. But Peter ſaid, Although all ſhall be offended, yet will not I. Jeſus ſaith unto him, This night, before the cock crow twice, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. But he ſpake the more vehemently, If I ſhould die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wiſe. Likewiſe alſo ſaid they all.</hi> I pray obſerve the words of the Scripture, Jeſus had told them, that that night they ſhould be all offended becauſe of him; and he proves the truth of it by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: for it was written, <hi>I will ſmite the ſhepherd, and the ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p ſhall be ſcattered.</hi> What Jeſus ſpake, was the truth he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Father. And did he not ſpake theſe words by the true Spirit? And yet this did not reach the ſeed of God in them, ſo as to believe he ſpake true: And therefore how could they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus ſpake theſe words by the true Spirit? yea, by their own anſwers it did appear, that they all believed that he ſpake them by a wrong Spirit, becauſe they all ſaid, that ſhould not be true that Jeſus had ſpoken; Jeſus had ſaid, that they ſhould be all offended becauſe of him that night, and the truth of that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſhould be fulfilled that night, that the Shepherd ſhould be ſmitten, and the Sheep ſcattered. <hi>Peter</hi> who had at another time, ſome diſtance of time between before that time, began to rebuke him for ſpeaking ſomething to that purpoſe, he does not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Jeſus for ſpeaking the truth; but he again contradicts him for ſpeaking the truth, and tells him, that what he had ſpoken, ſhould not be done: for although all ſhould be offended becauſe of him, yet would not he. And when Jeſus told him that that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152785:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> night, before the Cock crew twice, he ſhould deny him thrice; <hi>he ſpake the more vehemently, If I die with thee, I will not in any wiſe deny thee. Likewiſe alſo ſaid they all.</hi> That is, all of them ſaid, as <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid, that they would not be offended becauſe of him that night; and before they would deny him, they would die with him. As <hi>Peter</hi> in his own Will had reſolved to do, ſo had they reſolved in their Wills to do. I pray what hindred the true words ſpoken by Jeſus, that it did not reach the ſeed of God in them? Was it becauſe they were ſpoken by a wrong Spirit? Or was it not becauſe their own Wills lay uppermoſt in them, above the ſeed of God in them, and ſo made ſuch a ſeparation as that the words ſpoken by Jeſus could not reach the ſeed of God in them? Was it not their own Wills in them, that would not have them to be offended becauſe of him that night, being it was Gods will that it ſhould be ſo, and God had cauſed the Prophets to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the ſame? But there was in them all a Will oppoſing the Will of God; and that Will of theirs, was that which hindred that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus's true words ſpoken by the true Spirit, that they did not reach the ſeed of God in them; and this Will of theirs was troubled and burdened by the words ſpoken by Jeſus.</p>
               <p>What might not this Will ſay in them? or they ſay in this Will? What ſhall I, that have been a Diſciple, a Follower of Jeſus, that have been ſent by him to preach the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand, have had power to heal all manner of Diſeaſes, and to caſt out Devils, and have had my outward feet lately waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, and that night received of him that which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Sacrament of his Body and Bloud; and what ſhall I now be offended becauſe of this Jeſus that hath done ſo much for me? No, I will not be offended: no, rather than I will be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe of him, I will firſt die with him. This Will of theirs that was not willing that Gods Will ſhould be done in them, this Will of theirs was burdened and troubled in hearing Jeſus ſpeak thoſe true words, That that night they ſhould be all offended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him. And from this ſtrong fleſhly love and affection that they had to the fleſhly Body of Jeſus, might they not think, as others have done, that it was ſomething in them that was good, ſomething in them that was of God, that was troubled and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened at Jeſus ſpeaking of the true words by the true Spirit? When indeed, and in truth, that which was burdened and troubled at Jeſus's true words ſpoken by the true Spirit, it was nothing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152785:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> but the fleſhly will of theirs, in which will they oppoſed the will of God (as others have done in this knowing Age.) How were theſe deceived by the ſubtile Serpents ſelf their own wills in them, who hod been ſo much with Jeſus, and had received ſo much from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and yet had not taken up the Croſs to their own wills, but were in the knowing of Jeſus after the fleſh, and followers of Jeſus after the fleſh, and were ignorant of his Death and Reſurrection in them!</p>
               <p>Luke 18. 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Then took he unto him the Twelve, and ſaid unto them, Behold me, go unto Jeruſalem, and all things that are written by the Prophets concerning the Son of man ſhall be accompliſhed; for he ſhall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and ſhall be mocked and ſpitefully entreated, and ſpit on; and they ſhall ſcourge him and put him to death, and the third day he ſhall riſe again: and they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood none of theſe things, and the ſaying was hid from them, neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood they the things that were ſpoken.</hi> Does any one believe that Jeſus ſpake theſe true words, and that he did not ſpeak them by a true ſpirit, but that it was a wrong ſpirit in Jeſus that ſpake theſe words? I ſay, that if any one does believe that theſe true words (ſpoken by Jeſus) were not ſpoken by the true ſpirit, and if not ſpoken by the true ſpirit, then they muſt be ſpoken by the falſe ſpirit: They that do ſo believe, I believe they will be aſhamed to ſay, that they believe that Jeſus did not ſpeak theſe true words by the true ſpirit, and that he ſpake them by the wrong ſpirit. And if Jeſus did ſpeak theſe words by the true ſpirit, as that Jeſus did ſpeak them by the true ſpirit, then ſee the falſity and deceit that is in the Argument that I have heard often, and that by many uſed, that becauſe by the true words ſpoken, they did not feel them to reach the witneſs of God, the ſeed of God in them, when they heard them ſpoken; therefore it was that they believed the true words ſpoken, were not ſpoken by the true ſpirit, but by a wrong ſpirit: By the ſame rule the Twelve might have judged, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus did not ſpeak thoſe true words; and why? becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood none of theſe things, and the ſaying of his was hid from them, neither knew they the things that were ſpoken. If they had felt theſe words of Jeſus to have reached the witneſs of God, the ſeed of God in them, how then could it have been that they underſtood none of thoſe things, and his ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things that were ſpoken? if they had felt thoſe true words ſpoken by Jeſus, by the true light, and by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152785:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> him proved by Scriptures, not onely by one Scripture, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scriptures, by all things that are written by the Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, if they had felt theſe words to have reached the ſeed of God, the witneſs of God in them, they would have underſtood ſomething of thoſe ſayings, they would not all have been hid from them, they would have known ſomething of what had been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but by this Scripture it is plainly proved, that true words may be ſpoken by the true ſpirit, and proved by many Scriptures, and that too concerning Chriſts being put to death, and by whom, and the place where, and of his riſing again, and when he riſe: And all theſe may be ſpoken of the inward work of God in the heart of men (as the like I have known) and yet the Witneſs of God, the ſeed of God in the hearers, have not been by them felt to be reached unto, by the words ſo ſpoken (none of the Twelve underſtood any of the things Jeſus ſpake of; I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, none of his hearers underſtood any of the ſaying he ſpake.) And ſo although they have underſtood the outward ſound of the Words ſpoken, as the Twelve did the outward Words ſpoken by Jeſus, yet the inward meaning of them, the ſpiritual meaning of them, as they are wrought, asked, and done in man, may be hid from them, and they may know nothing of thoſe things ſpoken as to the Work of God in the heart; and yet they may be ſpoken to ſuch as the Twelve were, or at leaſt would be counted ſuch as the Twelve were; that is, thoſe that had the moſt familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Chriſt, who Jeſus had ſent forth to preach, that the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand, and had caſt out Devils in his Name: And yet theſe did not know what Chriſts Death and Reſurrection was, neither underſtood they any thing of it when he ſpake of it to them: And may there not be ſuch in this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Age we live in, that may for ſome years have been Diſciples and followers of Chriſt in the fleſh, and have had a familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, and have been ſent to preach the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, and have caſt out Devils in his Name, and yet have not known Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, nor have underſtood any thing of it, when it hath been ſpoken of to them by thoſe that have known the inward work of it wrought within them.</p>

What think ye? who dare ſay that they think or believe that the Diſciples the followers of Jeſus, to whom theſe words were ſpoken, had done well if they had gone to Jeſus and told him, although they could not deny but that thoſe words that he had ſpoken were true, yet they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned whether or no he ſpake them by the true and right ſpirit; and the reaſon why they queſtioned and did not believe he ſpake them by the right and true ſpirit, is this, Becauſe when they heard him ſpeak thoſe words, they did not feel that thoſe words ſpoken by him did reach the witneſs of God, the ſeed of God in them: Who dare ſo ſay, that they think or believe the Diſciples had done well, if they ſhould have gone to Jeſus, and uſed ſuch an Argument to have perſwaded Jeſus, that the words he ſpake were not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the true ſpirit, becauſe they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

               <p>If ſuch a light Argument as this had been ſufficient to have proved, that Jeſus true words had not been ſpoken by a true and right ſpirit, becauſe his words when ſpoken, did not reach to the witneſs of God, the ſeed of God in thoſe that heard him; how much then of his words would then have been proved to have been ſpoken by the wrong ſpirit? How little, and how ſeldom do we read in the Scripture, that thoſe that heard Chriſt ſpeak true words, and that by the true ſpirit, that the hearers of Jeſus did feel the witneſs of God, the ſeed of God reached in them, by Jeſus true words when he ſpake them? And yet yow many times have I heard that uſed as an Argument, and the onely Argument, to prove that the true words ſpoken, have not been ſpoken by the true ſpirit, but ſpoken by the wrong ſpirit! And why? becauſe thoſe when they heard them they did not feel the witneſs of God, the ſeed of God in them, reached by thoſe true words ſpoken; but they have found ſomething in them troubled and burdened when they heard thoſe words ſpoken: Jeſus Diſciples they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words ſpoken by him, they being hid from them, and they perceived them not, and they feared to ask him of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, they feared to ask him the meaning of that ſaying:

                  <hi>Balaam</hi> who uſed Inchantments, and loved the wages of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, I do not find in all the Scripture that ever he was reproved for the true words that he ſpake, that God put into him to ſpeak: Nor do I find that they were a burden or a trouble to any that heard him ſpeak them, unleſs it were to <hi>Balak,</hi> and thoſe with him, that would have had <hi>Iſrael</hi> curſed; and to them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Balaam</hi>'s words were a burden and a trouble unto.</p>

               <p>But I know an Objection or Argument may be made or raiſed, although I never heard it made or raiſed, yet I know it may be made or raiſed, and that to this purpoſe, That true words may be ſpoken by a wrong or evil ſpirit, and ſuch true words as the Scripture ſpeak, yea the very words of the Scripture, and brought in for Scripture, and brought in as a proof for what this wrong or evil ſpirit have been ſpoken to before. And ought this wrong ſpirit or evil ſpirit be ſuffered in going on to ſpeak theſe true words, although words of Scripture? or ought he not rather to be rebuked or put to ſilence, than ſuffer'd to go on in his ſpeaking of ſuch true words? And this Objection thus made, or Argument thus raiſed, they may ſeem to ground or lay the foundation of it upon the Devils tempting of Jeſus (<hi>Matth.</hi> 4.) in theſe words: <hi>The Devil taketh him up into the holy City, and ſetteth him on a pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Temple, and ſaith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down: for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone. Jeſus ſaith to him, It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Upon this Scripture, ſome may ſeem to raiſe ſuch an Objection or Argument as this, or to this purpoſe: That the wrong or evil ſpirit, or the ſpirit of the Devil in man, may ſpeak true words, the words of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and bring it for proof of what he had before ſaid; but that ſpirit is not to be ſuffered to ſpeak ſuch true words, but to be rebuked and put to ſilence, and that from this example of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>In anſwer thereunto, I do believe Jeſus example is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: And if there be any that from this Scripture do raiſe any ſuch-like Objection or Argument as I have here mentioned (as I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:152785:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſuppoſe there may and will be ſome ſuch) I ſay, it were well if they would follow Jeſus example, and read the whole temptation as it is written in the Scripture, <hi>Then Jeſus was led up of the ſpirit into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil</hi> (read it in the myſtery who can) <hi>And when he had faſted forty days and forty nights, he was afterwards an hungred;</hi> and when the Tempter came to him, he ſaid, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread; but he anſwered and ſaid, It is written, That man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God:</hi> I pray what rebuke was hear to the Devil, or putting him to ſilence, and cauſing him to keep ſilence, as Jeſus had power ſo to do, and could have done it, if it had pleaſed him.</p>
               <p>But Jeſus leaves this his anſwer to the Devil, as an example for us to follow, that if the Devil tempts us to the doing of any thing that is contrary to Gods declared will for us to obey him in, thing that was for Jeſus to make bread of ſtones to ſatisfie his hunger, and thereby to anſwer the Devil in his temptations, to give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſtation of his being Gods Son, than that the Father had before given of him, by a voice from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Jeſus he reſiſted the Devil in his Temptation, and bringeth Scripture to prove that it was not lawful for him to yield to his temptation, to command thoſe ſtones to be made bread to ſatisfie his hunger, and thereby to yield to his temptation by it to manifeſt himſelf to be the Son of God; and therefore he proved it by Scripture, that mans life did not conſiſt by bread alone, but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God; and this he hath left as an example for us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Doth the Devil tempt thee to the doing of any thing that is contrary to Gods declared will for thee to do, to ſupply thee in any want that thou art in, if it be either an inward want of the bread from Heaven, or an outward want of any outward thing (as Jeſus being hungry wanted bread) and thereby have thee to yield to his Temptation, and give another manifeſtation or making known that thou art the Son of God. Then that making known to thee that thou art his Son by the voice that thou haſt heard from the Kingdom of Heaven that is in thee; and in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in that Rule, in that Government, that thou knoweſt that God hath in thee, which is his Kingdom in thee, wherein and whereby he hath made known in thee and to thee, that thou art, as thou art, in his Son Jeſus in thee, that ſaves thee from thy ſins,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152785:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſo in his Son Jeſus thou art his beloved Son in whom he is well pleaſed. And do thou not ſo much ſeek to ſtop or put to ſilence the Devil in thee in his temptations, if it were in thy power ſo to do (as it was in Jeſus power) as to reſiſt him in his Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and to bring Scripture to prove that we ought not to yield to his Temptations. Jeſus did not ſtop or put to ſilence the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, although it was in his power ſo to do, when he thus tempted him; and therefore that is an anſwer to that part of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether by the example of Jeſus the wrong or evil ſpirit is not to be ſtopped or put to ſilence, and not ſuffer'd to ſpeak; for Jeſus he did not ſtop and put to ſilence the Devil, but ſuffer'd him ſtill to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Devil taketh him up into the holy City, and ſetteth him on a pinacle of the Temple, and ſaith unto him, If thou be the ſon of God, caſt thy ſelf down; for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bare thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh-thy foot againſt a ſtone. Jeſus ſaith unto him, It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> I pray what rebuke or putting the Devil to ſilence, or ſtopping of his mouth was here by Jeſus anſwer to this Temptation, more than was in his anſwer to the former Temptation, although the Devil brings Scripture as an argument to preſs Jeſus to yield to him in this his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that becauſe Jeſus had reſiſted the Devil in the former tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and proved it by Scripture that he ought not to yield to his Temptation. Now the Devil brings Scripture as an argument to have him yield to his Temptation, telling him there was no danger to befal him if he yielded to him in his Temptation, in caſting himſelf down from that pinacle, if he were the Son of God he might ſafely do it, becauſe it is written, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> I ſay, what rebuke did Jeſus give the Devil for ſpeaking of Scripture-words? I find no more rebuke that he gave him when he made uſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as an Argument to perſwade him to yield to his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor no more ſtopping of his mouth and putting him to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than he did when he made an anſwer to the former Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation when the Devil made uſe of no Scripture, as he made uſe of no Scripture when he tempted him to make bread of ſtones. And this is a full anſwer to the Objection, for Jeſus did not rebuke the Devil, nor ſtop his mouth, nor put him more to ſilence when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152785:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> he made uſe of the Scripture as an Argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> perſwade him to yield to his Temptation, than he did rebuke him, ſtop his mouth, and put him to ſilence, when he ſpake no Scripture in tempting of him; no, nor ſo much neither: for you will find in the next Temptation, when the Devil makes no uſe of Scripture, he rebukes him more ſharply, and ſtops his mouth, and puts him to ſilence. And therefore there is no ground from this Scripture to build ſuch an Objection or Argument upon, that an evil or wrong ſpirit, or the ſpirit of the Devil in man, may ſpeak true words, the words of the Scripture, and bring it in for a proof of what he had before ſaid; but ſuch a ſpirit is not to be ſuffered to ſpeak ſuch words, but to be rebuked and put to ſilence, according to Jeſus's Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when Jeſus did no ſuch thing, nor gave no ſuch Example.</p>
               <p>But before I paſs from this Temptation, I deſire the Objecter to follow Jeſus's Example, which is our duty ſo to do. Doth the Devil get thee into the holy City (the holy City of God in man) and ſet thee upon a Pinacle of the Temple there within thee, read it within, and would have thee caſt thy ſelf down from thence, where he hath exalted thee in the holy City upon a Pinacle of the Temple of God in thee, thereby to manifeſt thy ſelf to be the ſon of God, thereby to make it known that thou art Gods ſon, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way than the way that God hath declared thee to be his ſon in? read it within. And does he bring Scripture to thee to prove that thou mayſt ſafely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do it, thou mayſt tempt God in making known thy ſelf to be his ſon in a way he hath not commanded, and it will be no danger to thee to do it? read it within. I could tell my experience herein, but I know it will be with many in this knowing Age, as it was with the Eleven, when Jeſus had many things to ſay to them, but they could not bear them then, <hi>John</hi> 16. 12. but the time is coming, and at hand, when men ſhall read them within, and then it will be born; when true words may by all be ſpoken, and will be born without being a burden o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> trouble to any of the Hearers that obey the Light in them, and make it their Guide to guide them into all Truth: Then it will be known to be a duty to follow Jeſus's Example, to reſiſt the Temptation, how highly ſoever he hath exalted thee and lifted thee up in his Temptation; as he did Jeſus in bringing him into the holy City, and ſetting him upon a Pinacle of the Temple, and then and there would have him to manifeſt himſelf to be the ſon of God, and brings Scripture to prove the lawfulneſs thereof.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152785:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> Which I know are all Figures, and are to be read and known within.</p>
               <p>And if thou find the Devil thus to tempt thee, as ſome have done, follow Jeſus's Example; do not ſo much ſeek to ſtop the mouth of the temptation, as to ſtand faſt in thy obedience in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Jeſus in the low and meek Spirit, and bring Scripture to contradict the Temptation, as Jeſus did: He tells the Devil, <hi>It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> The Devil brought Scripture to prove, that if he were the ſon of God, that God had given his Angels charge to keep him from harm. Jeſus anſwered the Devil, <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Which as no Scripture is of private interpretation, ſo is not this. And in theſe few words Jeſus, according to our Proverb, <hi>Kill two Birds with one ſtone,</hi> he tells the Devil, that it is not his duty to tempt him as he is his Lord and God; nor was it his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he was man, and the ſon of God, to tempt the Father in caſting himſelf down from thence, becauſe the Father had ſo great a love for him, as to give his Angels charge concerning him to keep him from harm. And when this Example of Jeſus is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reſiſting of the Devil in his Temptations, the Croſs will be taken up to that Will that would run out to judge, to rebuke, to ſtop the mouth, and to make them keep ſilence that are ſpeaking of true words: for Jeſus did not ſo rebuke the Devil for ſpeaking true words, as to ſtop his mouth, or make him keep ſilence.</p>
               <p>Becauſe that again, after this, <hi>the devil taketh him up into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high mountain, and ſheweth him all the kingdoms of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the glory of them: And ſaith, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve. Then the devil leaveth him.</hi> I pray hear, the Devil brings no Scripture, nor ſpeaks nothing to him whereby he would have him manifeſt himſelf to be the ſon of God in yielding to him in his Temptations. In this Temptation he onely got him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them; and promiſes to give him all them, if he would fall down and worſhip him. And for this ſetting of him upon an high Mountain, which I know is to be read within; and then ſhewing of him all the Kingdoms of the World, which is to be read within; and then telling him, All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152785:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> and worſhip me, which alſo may be read within. All of them I know to be Figures.</p>
               <p>And for this Temptation Jeſus rebukes him more ſharper, than for the other two; and if I may uſe ſuch an expreſſion, he did more ſtop his mouth and put him to ſilence, than he did in the other two Temptations: Firſt, he bids him get him hence <hi>Satan;</hi> he did not before command the Devil to depart from him, nor did he call him <hi>Satan;</hi> when in the other two Temptations he would have had him anſwered his Temptations by making himſelf known to be the ſon of God, in ways that God had not required of him to manifeſt himſelf to be his ſon in; and for the laſt of the two, he brings Scripture to prove that he might do it with his own ſafety: and yet in neither of thoſe two Temptations he did not command him to depart from him, nor call him <hi>Satan.</hi> But now when he had taken him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them; now to tempt him to have ſuch a love to the World, to the enjoyments thereof, and the glory of it, as for the ſake thereof to fall down and worſhip him. This cauſed Jeſus to command the Devil to depart from him, and to call him <hi>Satan,</hi> Tempter, and bring Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for his denying to yield to the Temptation: <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve. Then the devil leaveth him.</hi> And if in any of the Devils Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Jeſus may be ſaid to ſtop the mouth of the Devil, and cauſe him to keep ſilence, it was in this, when he tempts him to have a love to the World, and ſuch a love to the World and the glory of it, as for the enjoyment of it, he ſhould fall down and worſhip him. And Jeſus did not onely reſiſt the Devil in his Temptation, and rebuke him, commanding him to depart from him, and kept him for that time for ſpeaking any more to him; but he brings Scripture to prove the unlawfulneſs of the yielding to the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> This Scripture may alſo have two interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: firſt, that it was the duty of the Devil to worſhip Jeſus as his Lord and God, and not Jeſus to worſhip the Devil; and then, as Jeſus was man, and the ſon of God, ſo it was not his duty to fall down to the Devil and worſhip him, but to worſhip the Father as his Lord and God.</p>
               <p>And it were well if all the Objecters, and all others, would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Example of Jeſus, that when the Devil getteth them up

                  </gap>to the exceeding high Mountain of the earthy part in them, of that which hath a love to the world within them, and there ſhew them all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them, and promiſe to give them all, to fall down and worſhip him; that thus they reſiſt the Devil, and command him from them, and as much as in them lieth, not ſuffer him to ſpeak of ſuch a thing to them, as to perſwade them to have ſuch a love to the World, and the glory thereof, (wherein all things of the world within man, which is mans ſelf, mans Will, and all things without man, that is, all outward Creatures, is contained and comprehended) as for it to fall down and worſhip the Devil; and for the love of the World, and the glory thereof, to ſerve and obey the Devil: No, no, anſwer with Jeſus, <hi>Get thee hence, Satan; get thee hence, Tempter: It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And if I yield to thy Temptations to love the World, and the glory of it, and ſo in that my love to the World, or to any part of it, either within me or without me, I fall down and worſhip thee; then I cannot worſhip my Lord and my God onely, but I ſhall be a Worſhipper and a Server of thee: No, no, this muſt not be.</p>
               <p>In and under theſe three Temptations, I believe that all the Temptations that man meets withal, may be contained or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; as all Prayers are contained or comprehended in that Prayer Jeſus taught his Diſciples to pray. And ſee Jeſus in all theſe Temptations makes uſe of the Scriptures in his reſiſting of the Devil in his Temptations; and thereby, as man, to ſhew the lawfulneſs and the uſefulneſs that was in his making uſe of the Scriptures to reſiſt the Devil in his Temptations. And I believe it is our duty to follow Jeſus's Example therein. That it is our duty by the Scriptures to prove and try our works, actions, and doings, whether they be done by the Spirit of Jeſus in us, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Devil in that outward body of Jeſus, <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay:</hi> And if our works, actions, and doings cannot be proved by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be according to the declared Will of God that he hath made known to man, that is, his Will that man ſhould obey him in; as Jeſus in that outward body, did by the Scriptures prove, that his works, actions, and doings were according to Gods decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Will in the Scriptures that he ſhould do: and ſo he made uſe of the Scriptures not onely in that which is mentioned of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the Devil in his Temptations, but in his other works,

And when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of him to be the Body prepared by God to do Gods will, which pleaſed God better than outward Sacrifice and Offerings, he ſaith of him, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God, as it is written of me in the volume of the book.</hi> There is a <hi>lo,</hi> a behold put to it, that is, it is to be taken notice of that Jeſus came to do in that body the will of God the Father, as it was Gods declared will written in the Scriptures that he ſhould do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>I do believe, and dare be bold to ſay it, that they are not the works, actions, and doings of the ſame Spirit of Jeſus in man, that was in that outward man Jeſus, which man doth and refuſeth to bring to the Scriptures to prove that they are done according to Gods declared will written in the Scriptures, that man is to do in obedience to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Jeſus did not onely make uſe of the Scriptures to reſiſt the Devil in his Temptations, but thereby to ſhew that what he did in reſiſting of the Devil, was according to Gods declared will written in the Scriptures; as he did in many other of his particular works and actions, he made uſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to prove by the Scripture, that it was according to Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will written in the Scriptures that he ſhould do: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe that I may ſafely conclude, that thoſe works, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and doings that are done by any that cannot be proved by the Scriptures to be Gods declared will for man to do in obedience to him, that they are not wrought, acted, and done by the ſame Spirit of Jeſus in them, that wrought, acted, and did thoſe things that God in the Scripture had declared to be his will to be done in that body. And I think I do them no wrong, to judge that thoſe works, actions, and doings that is not done according to what they can prove by Scripture to be done according to Gods declared will therein written; that ſuch works, actions, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they are not the works, actions, or doings of Jeſus in them, as he is in them to ſave them from ſin; but they are the works, actions, and doings of a wrong ſpirit or will in them, which would not have that done in thoſe bodies of theirs, that was and is Gods declared will written in the Scriptures that they ſhould do and obey God in.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:152785:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But perhaps ſome may object and ſpeak to this purpoſe: We have the Light in us, and that is the true Light that is in us, and it is the ſame true Light that is the Word of God it ſelf, and it is that which gave forth the Scriptures; and what wouldſt thou have us bring this Light in us to the Scriptures to be judged by them? Or wouldſt thou have us bring our works and actions done in us by this Light, to the Scriptures to be judged? Or wilt thou have us bring our obedience done by this Light in us, to be proved by the Scriptures, whether or no they be ſuch things as God requires of us to be done? What wouldſt thou have us to bring the Light to be tryed by the Scriptures, that gave forth the Scriptures? What, to try the Creator by the Creature, the Maker by the thing made? What, wouldſt thou have the Spirit tried by the dead Letter?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, The Light, the true Light is one and the ſame, it never alters nor changes, and it is one and the ſame in all men, as it is the true Light that lighteth every man that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the World; and it is the ſame in thoſe that have no Scriptures, in thoſe that have nothing outwardly written that was given forth by the holy men that ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt: It is the ſame true Light in thoſe that have no Scriptures, as it is in thoſe that have the Scriptures. And if that be the Argument, that becauſe we have the Light in us that gave forth the Scriptures, therefore we need not make uſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or not ſo much uſe of them as to bring our works, actions, and doings to them to be tryed by them, to ſee if they be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the works, actions, or doings done by the holy men of old, by that ſpirit in them that gave forth the Scriptures; or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to what the holy men of old gave forth in the Scriptures to be Gods will for man to do. I ask them that make this for an Objection, this Queſtion, Whether or no Jeſus had not, as man, as much of this Light in him as thou haſt? And yet he made uſe of the Scriptures to prove that what he did, was agreeable to Gods declared will written in the Scriptures, that he as a ſon ought to do in obedience to the Father. It is true, that thoſe that have not the Scriptures, they cannot bring their works to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to try them whether or no their works are agreeable to thoſe works done by the holy men of old, or agreeable to that which the holy men of old gave forth in the Scriptures to be Gods will that man ſhould obey him in. Theſe not having the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152785:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> Law written without them, they cannot bring their works to a written Law without them, to be tryed by that; but they having onely the Law written within them, in their hearts they bring their works to that Law to be tryed by that written Law in their hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>But for others that have the Law and the Prophets, and the Writings of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and of the Apoſtles, without them; for them that have the Scriptures to talk of, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light to be tryed by the Scriptures, that is, to bring the ſpirit the Life that gave forth the Scriptures, to be tryed by the dead Letter: Is not this a piece of the Serpents ſubtile deceit, to talk after this manner? But for thoſe that have the Scriptures for them to bring their works, actions, and doings of thoſe that own that they have the true Light in them, and walk in obedience to that Light in them; for them to bring this obedience of theirs that they ſay is done by the true Light, (and not to bring the true Light it ſelf) to prove that by Scripture, (that is, to prove their obedience to the Light by the Scripture, and not to prove the true Light by the Scripture) whether or no their obedience be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the obedience wrought in the holy men of old, by the ſame ſpirit that gave forth the Scriptures, by the true Light, that ſpirit of God in them that gave forth the Scriptures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath made known to man what is his will that man ſhould do, and what is his will that man ſhould not do. This is that which we that have the Scriptures, ſhould bring to the Scriptures to prove the truth of; not to prove the truth of the Light, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be true or no, but to prove the truth of our obedience to the Light in our works, actions, and doings, to prove whether they be wrought in us by the true Light the ſpirit of God in us, or whether they be wrought in us by the ſubtilty of the Serpent in us: for there is in man but two Natures whereby and from whence all our works, actions, and doings come and proceed, that is, the ſeed of the woman, and the Serpent and his ſeed; and whatſoever is not done in us by the ſeed of the woman in us, by Jeſus the true Light in us, is done in us by the Serpent and his ſeed in us. And this is that we are to bring to the Scriptures to be proved and tryed by, whether or no our works, doings, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that be done in us, be done in us by the ſeed of the woman, or by the Serpent and his ſeed; and for that they are true Rules for us to know by, that is, true Rules for us to know by which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152785:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> Nature in us our works, actions, or doings are wrought in us. And is not that but a piece of the ſubtile Serpents deceit, to talk of ſuch a thing as of bringing the Light in them to the Scriptures, to be tryed by them whether it is the true Light or no? That is no other but to bring the ſpirit to be tryed by the Letter, which cannot be. And by their ſo talking of bringing the Light, the ſpirit to be tryed by the letter of the Scriptures, do they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by put a ſlight or undervaluing of the true Light or ſpirit that gave forth the Scriptures? Or are they not ſuch who do ſo talk, that ſeek by their ſo talking to make the Scriptures of little or no uſe, but onely as to what things they pleaſe, and when they pleaſe, and where they pleaſe?</p>
               <p>As if the Light, the true Light and ſpirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures by the holy men of God, was one thing then in them, and did one thing then in them, in making known what was Gods declared will for man to do in obedience to him, and that it is another thing now in man, in making known another thing now to be the will of God that man ſhould do, and that is contrary to what was Gods will declared in the Scriptures. I know that as to an outward form of Worſhip, God did make known one thing to be his mind and will to the Prophets, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing to the Apoſtles; but however, here was no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; that outward form of Worſhip in the time of the Law and the Prophets, did not contradict that outward form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that was in the Apoſtles time; nor did that outward form in the Apoſtles time, contradict that outward form of Worſhip that was in the time of the Law and the Prophets. The one was but a Type and Figure of the other, and what was in the one was in the other, as God was in them both worſhipped as a ſpirit; and the Worſhip that then was and now is performed, as God then did and now doth look for and accept of, is to worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth: and ſo in that there was no contradiction. There was not one thing that was Gods will for man to obey him in the days of the Prophets, and another thing in the days of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles that was to be done in man, and that in obedience to God; which was contrary to that which was Gods revealed will to be done in the days of the Prophets, that they were to obey God in: No, there was no ſuch contradiction. And that now there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing wherein God is to be obeyed in, (in theſe days of Gods making the Light to ſhine more in the inward part of man than
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152785:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> formerly) and this other thing that God is now to be obeyed in, as ſome would have it, that are not willing to bring their works; deeds, or actions to the Scriptures to be tryed by them, whether or no they be agreeable to the works, deeds or actions of the holy men of old, by whom God by the ſpirit by the true light gave forth the Scriptures, and in them gave forth what was his will that man ſhould do in obedience to him. This other thing that ſome pretends by the light in them, that they are now to obey God in, is contrary and not agreeable to Gods declared will in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and ſo they make the unchangeable God, to be like chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable men, to have one thing to be his will for man to obey him in at one time, and another thing quite contrary to that to be his will for man to obey him in at another time.</p>
               <p>Jeſus the true light, the Word of God, by whoſe ſpirit the holy men of old ſpake, as they were moved in giving forth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, both Prophets and Apoſtles; it was the command of this Jeſus, this true light, this ſpirit that gave forth the Scriptures, in that outward body that he took in the nature of man, <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> John 5. 39. And he giveth the reaſon why it is that he commands them to ſearch the Scriptures, it was becauſe they are they that teſtifie of him, they are they that bear witneſs, they are they that teſtifie, that bear witneſs what he is; they are they that teſtifie, which witneſs what was the Fathers will that as man he was to do; they are they that teſtifie, that bear witneſs that as he was man, he came not to do his own will, but the will of the Father that ſent him. They are they that teſtifie, that bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs what Jeſus the true light, the Word of God in man is: And they are they that teſtifie, that bear witneſs what this true light is in every man, and what this true light Jeſus doth in every man. They are they, that is, the Scriptures are they that teſtifie, that bear witneſs how this true light Jeſus by his ſpirit it teacheth, it guideth, it leadeth man into the doing of all that is of the Truth, by that ſpirit, that is, of his ſending forth according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he would ſend the ſpirit of truth, and when he is come he ſhall guide them into all truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak, <hi>for he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of mine, and ſhew it to you,</hi> John 16: 13, 14. How do they diſobey Jeſus Command, that refuſe to bring their works, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and doings to the Scriptures to be tryed by them, whether or no they are the works, actions, and doings of Jeſus the true light
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152785:72" rendition="simple:additions"/> in them, and that under a pretence becauſe Jeſus the true light is in them, and therefore it is that they need not or ought not to do it! And how willingly are they to be deceived, in thinking what is done in them, and by them, is done in and by Jeſus the true light in them! And yet will not bring it to that which Jeſus ſaith, teſtifieth, which bear witneſs to what is the works of Jeſus in them!</p>
               <p>And therefore there is great reaſon why the Scriptures are to be ſearched, to be ſought after, ſearched and ſought into, to find out what it is that they teſtifie, what it is that they bear witneſs of Jeſus to be, as he is the true Light, the Word of God, the Saviour of man. As he ſends his ſpirit of Truth into man to make known to man what that ſpirit receives from him, and thereby to guide man into all Truth; and whatever it is in man that pretends to be the work, actions, or doings of the Light of Jeſus in them, and is not agreeable to the teſtimony, the witneſs that the Scripture bears of Jeſus the true Light, and of his works, actions, or doings in man. And if that be true that Jeſus ſaid (as I believe none dare deny the truth of it) that the Scriptures teſtifie of him, then thoſe works, actions, or doings that they do not teſtifie to be the works of Jeſus in man, as he is the true Light, and ſends his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to guide them into all Truth, may very well be looked upon and judged to be the work of <hi>Satan,</hi> the ſubtile Serpent in man, transforming himſelf into the likeneſs of an Angel of Light; which <hi>Satan</hi> did in the Apoſtles time upon the like occaſion, read 2 <hi>Corinth. 11. 13, 14, 15. For ſuch are falſe Apoſtles, deceitful workers, transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt. And no marvel, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing, if his miniſters alſo be transformed as the miniſters of righteouſneſs,</hi> but let them be ſo, yet their <hi>end ſhall be according to their works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, and how it is our duty to follow Chriſt's Example, he brings Scripture to prove the truth of what he ſaid, <hi>Rom. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4. We therefore that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his good to his edification. For even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, but as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell on me. For whatſoever things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the ſcriptures might have hope.</hi> The Apoſtle here ſets
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152785:72" rendition="simple:additions"/> down the duty of thoſe that are ſtrong (and may I not ſay, of thoſe that would be thought or do think themſelves ſtronger than others?) and that is not to pleaſe themſelves, to ſatisfie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves in that they are ſtronger than others, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themſelves over and above thoſe that are weak; but their duty is to bear the infirmities of the weak, and thereby to pleaſe his neighbour for that is good to edification. And it this their ſo doing that was to follow the example of Chriſt who pleaſed not himſelf, and that he proves by Scripture, that it was the duty of the ſtrong to follow Chriſts example, and that Chriſt did not pleaſe himſelf, becauſe it is written, <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.</hi> And then he tells them, <hi>That what was written in the Scripture aforetime, was written for them to learn.</hi> I pray, what is it that we ſhould learn by the Scripture, if we are not to learn thereby to follow Chriſts example, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our works; actions, or doings by the Scriptures? Was it not Chriſts practice to make uſe of the Scriptures to prove, that what he did was according to Gods declared will made known by the Prophets? and was it not the practice of the Apoſtle? ſee for one place the afore-mentioned Scripture, where the Apoſtle does not onely bring Scripture to prove what was his and the Saints duty for them to do, but he alſo brings Scripture to prove that Chriſt did the ſame things that was written of him in the Scriptures that he ſhould do; and alſo that it was and is the duty of thoſe that are Chriſts Diſciples to follow him in what he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did, which was according to Gods declared will in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that he ſhould do: And many other places of Scripture there be that Chriſt and his Apoſtles made uſe of the Scriptures to prove, that what they did was agreeable to the will of God, before declared by the holy men of God.</p>
               <p>And I hope none will deny it in words, and therefore I ſhall bring no more Scripture to prove that it was the practice of Chriſt, and followed by the Apoſtles; and yet theſe were ſuch as had the ſame true light in ehem that gave forth the Scriptures: And do any men think themſelves better than Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and that becauſe the ſame true light that is in them that was in Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and that therefore they ought not to bring their works, actions, and doings to the Scriptures to be tryed by them, to ſee whether they be agreeable to the works, actions, or doings of the holy men of old, done in them by that ſpirit that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152785:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> gave forth the Scriptures; or whether they be agreeable to the will of God declared in the Scriptures by thoſe holy men of old, that was and is Gods will for us to obey him in. The Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning,</hi> (What? were they written onely for the learning of the Apoſtles, and thoſe in that day? And what, were they not written for our learning now in this day of the ſhining forth of the light amongſt us? And to the ſame end that we through pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and the comfort of the Scriptures might have hope: And have we not comfort and hope by bringing our works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> actions, and doings to the Scriptures, to try them by the Scriptures? I ſay, to try our works, actions, or doings by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures?</p>
               <p>I do not ſay to try the true light that is in us by the Scriptures, that is a falſity and deceit to ſpeak after that manner; but to try our works, actions, and doings by the Scriptures, to ſee how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing they are to the works, actions, and doings of the holy men of God in thoſe things that the Scripture make mention of, that they were carried forth by the ſpirit of God, the true light in them to do; and alſo to try our works, actions, and doings by thoſe things written in the Scripture, that the holy men gave forth by the ſpirit of God in them, the true light, that is, the duty for man to do, according to the declared will of God. Now as we bring our works, actions, or doings to this Touch-ſtone to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, and find that our works, actions, or doings, are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what the holy men of old did in obedience to God; and as they in obedience to God declared what was Gods will that man ſhould obey him in: I ſay, as men thus bring their works, actions, or doings to the holy Scripture to be tryed by it, whether they are agreeable to the works, actions or doings that God by his ſpirit, the true light, wrought in the holy men of old that gave forth the Scriptures; or agreeable to what God by the ſpirit of the true light gave in command to the holy men of old, that man ought to do in obedience to God.</p>
               <p>And when they have brought their works, actions, or doings to the Scriptures thus to be tryed, and find them anſwerable and agreeing to the works, actions, or doings wrought by Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the true light in the holy men of old, or anſwerable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to the works, actions, or doings given forth from God by the holy men of old for man to obey God in. As they thus find
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152785:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> their works, actions or doings to be anſwerable and agreeing to and with the Scriptures, ſo are the Scriptures a comfort and hope to them; that as the holy men of God in old time did enjoy the love and favour of God in this life, and more in the life to come, as is made known in the Scriptures, ſo if we with patience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in our obedience (by the help and aſſiſtance of the true light in us) to God, according to Gods declared will in the Scriptures, God may and will do the like by us and for us, as he did for the holy men of old: And this Comfort and Hope I have and do now find in the Scriptures, for ſome years before I heard of the name of a Quaker, I by experience had found that the Letter of the Scripture killed, and from that death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I was made ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable of that I got by truſting in that knowledge that I had by the Letter of the Scriptures, thinking by that knowledge to have eternal life, it made me afraid to read the Scriptures for above a year, fearing thereby I ſhould be a means to hinder my ſelf of that life that was to be had in and by the ſpirit that gave forth the Scriptures; and I did declare that the Scriptures were not the Word of God, but that was the Word of God by which all things were made; but the Scriptures as they were given forth by the ſpirit of God, as he moved the holy men to ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them, ſo they were the words ſpoken by God.</p>
               <p>And now I do give that honour to the Scriptures that <hi>Paul</hi> writ of, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17. And from a child thou haſt known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation through faith, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed unto all good works; here is the right uſe that is to be made of the Scriptures; they are able to make wiſe unto ſalvation; but it muſt be through that faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus, it muſt be by believing that there is a power in Chriſt Jeſus the true light to ſave us; and in that belief to yield an obedience to God, in what God hath made known to us to be his will to obey him in. In this faith, manifeſted by obedience, the Scriptures are able to make wiſe unto ſalvation: and then as they are given by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, they are profitable for Doctrine, whatever is taught ought to be agreeable to the Scripture, and the Scriptures are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for reproof, all reproof ought to be agreeable to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and they are profitable for correction, all correction ought
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152785:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be agreeable to the Scriptures; and they are profitable for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in righteouſneſs, all inſtruction in righteouſneſs is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Scripture, that by this means the man of God may be perfect throughly furniſhed unto good works. How is the man of God to be made perfect throughly furniſhed unto good works? that is, how is the man of God to know perfectly and throughly what are thoſe good works that God requires of him to do? Is it not by the knowing of them, as God hath been pleaſed to make known what is his revealed will for man to obey him in, as they are written in the Scriptures? I ſpeak this as <hi>Paul</hi> did of thoſe that have the Scriptures, as <hi>Timothy</hi> had, and not of thoſe that have not the Scriptures, who by the true Light, the power of them Divine Nature in them, do thoſe things that God hath written in his Law within them; by which Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> written in them, as they yield an obedience to it, God perfectly and throughly furniſhes the unto good works, according to his revealed will written within them.</p>
               <p>This is to make the right uſe of the Scriptures, and not to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize them on the one hand, as if eternal life was to be had in them, as did the Jews, and as once I did; nor to undervalue them on the other hand, as ſome do, who becauſe the true Light is in them (and the ſame true light is in all men) and therefore they undervalue the Scriptures, becauſe that is in them that gave forth the Scriptures. And they are all undervaluers of the Scriptures, who refuſe to bring their works, actions, or doings to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to try them by the Scriptures whether thoſe works, actions, or doings of them, be the works, actions, or doings of Jeſus the true Light in them. Jeſus and the Apoſtles proved their works, actions, or doings by the Scriptures, that they were done by the true Light in them; that is, that they were done as God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be his will that they ſhould do, as it is written in the Scriptures, which the holy men ſpake as they were moved by the true light in them: And if any ones works, actions, or doings be the work of the true Light Jeſus in them, then they are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and like the works, actions of the holy men who gave forth the Scripture, as thoſe holy men wrought, acted, or did by the working, acting, or doing by the ſame ſpirit in them that gave forth the Scripture, or agreeable and like the works, actions, or doings that the holy men by the ſpirit, the true Light in them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Gods mind and will for man to do. And thoſe

               <p>It was Gods Command to <hi>Iſaiah (chap.</hi> 8.) to bind up the Teſtimony and ſeal the Law among his Diſciples, and that people ſhould ſeek to their God, to the Law and to the Teſtimony: If they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light in them. In <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s days, when the Scriptures were leſs than they are now, yet they were then to be bound up and ſealed amongſt Gods Diſciples, and people were then to ſeek to their God, to the Law and to the Teſtimony; and if they did not then ſpeak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Word of the Law and Teſtimony then written in the Scriptures, it was becauſe there was no light in them; that is to ſay, they did not ſpeak according to the movings of the true light in them, for man cannot ſhut or keep out the true light from being in him: The true light Jeſus is and will be in man, teaching him what is Gods will for him to do, and ſo enabling of him to do Gods will, if he will believe in the Name, in the Power of this Jeſus the true Light, that there is a power in this light to ſave from ſin, if he will yield an obedience to it, in leaving and forſaking the doing of that which this light in him tells him God hath forbidden him to do; and if man will not yield obedience to this true light the ſpirit of God in him, and thereby come to be ſaved from ſin, then this

               <p>But the true light is not in them, ſo as that they are brought into the obedience of the light, and ſo it may be ſaid not to be in them. The light of the body is the eye, if therefore thine eye be ſingle, the whole body is full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body ſhall be full of darkneſs. If therefore the light that is in thee, be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs? <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22, 23. While the eye of the underſtanding and knowing part in man is ſingle, that is, alone and onely for God, and deſire nothing in that underſtanding and knowledge, but Gods will to be done in his obeying God according to that underſtanding and knowledge that they have of God, then the whole body is full of light, full of obedience; but if the eye be evil, if in the underſtanding and knowledge we have of God, we deſire more to pleaſe, ſatisfie, and content our ſelves in that we know what is Gods declared will that we ſhould do, then to yield an obedience to God in what we know, this makes the eye of the underſtanding and knowing part in man evil, and then the whole body ſhall be full of darkneſs, full of diſobedience. If therefore the light that is in us be darkneſs, if therefore we have an underſtanding and knowledge of what is Gods will that we ſhould do, and we obey not God according to what we know of God, how great is that darkneſs? how great is that diſobedience? And therefore what great need is there for man to know that he hath denyed himſelf, denyed all that is of ſelf, and taken up his Croſs to his own will: Without the doing thereof, there is no following of Jeſus, no being a Diſciple of Jeſus, no follower, no learner of obedience to that Jeſus, to that true Light in us, that is there in us to ſave us from ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the denying of our ſelves, and taking up the Croſs to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</p>
               <p>And if it be objected, <hi>Can man deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow Jeſus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, What man may do of himſelf, in ſeeking, in labouring to deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and to follow Jeſus, that is only ſelf, and is no denyal of ſelf, nor taking up of any Croſs to ſelf:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152785:75" rendition="simple:additions"/> I know by experience, that the ſubtile Serpent ſelf in man is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting man upon that, to think that of himſelf he can deny himſelf, and follow Jeſus. I read in the Scripture, that <hi>the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is like unto leaven, that a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, until the whole was leavened,</hi> Mat. 13. 33. I pray mark the words of the Scripture; it is not, that the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto Leaven that a man took and hid in three meaſures of meal, although baking was an Employment uſed by men many years before Chriſt ſpake this Parable, we read of it to be uſed by men in the time that <hi>Joſeph</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jacob</hi> was in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but it is like unto Leaven which a woman took and hid in three mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of meal. When I began to write, and did write that the woman in the myſtery is mans being drawn by the ſpirit, or the leadings or goings forth of man by the ſpirit of Jeſus in man, I then had not the leaſt thoughts of this Parable; but this is the woman that takes the Leaven, and not man. Man of himſelf he cannot take the Leaven that worketh the change in him; no, man cannot do it: it is the work of Jeſus in man drawing him forth by his ſpirit to take the Leaven. The Leaven, it is the love of God, the manifeſtations, the making known of Gods love to man; and there in man to hide it, as the outward woman hid the outward Leaven in the three meaſures of meal, until the whole be changed, until the whole be leavened, until the whole be made like the Leaven. So the woman in man, that is, mans being drawn, led, or carried out by the working of the ſpirit of Jeſus in him, ſhe took, that is, the woman, the goings forth of the ſpirit of Jeſus in man, it is that which takes in the love of God to man, and hides it in man, in the three meaſures of meal, until the whole be leavened, until the whole be changed and made like the Leaven, like the love of God. As the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> and ſo the love of God being taken in and hid in man, it worketh that change in man as to make man love God again.</p>
               <p>Self in man, according to what I know and underſtand of it in me, and ſo, and not otherwiſe, I am to ſpeak and declare of it. Self is made up of theſe three parts or properties: The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or knowing part in man, as it is in union with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Serpent: The deſire, love, and affectionated part in man, as it is let out after the Creation: And the Will in man, as ſeparated from the Will of God. Theſe three joyned and united together,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152785:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> as the one is not without the other, they are unſeparable. They make what to my underſtanding is ſelf in man, I having firſt found that my falling upon the ſtone of the apprehenſions of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Judgments for ſin, it had broken me to pieces, had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, had diſquietted me, had cauſed me to mourn for my ſins, and to repent of them, and to pray againſt them; I now have found the ſtone of Gods Juſtice and Judgment to fall upon all theſe three parts or properties of ſelf in me, and grinding them to pieces. I have known ſo much of Gods Juſtice and Judgments to fall upon me for that underſtanding and knowledge, that by the Serpents ſubtilty I had gained in reading the Scriptures and other books, and by-words that I had heard ſpoken by men and in diſcourſe with men, that I was ſo much broken a pieces under the manifeſtations and makings known to me of Gods Juſtice, for my knowing more of the Will of God than I yielded obedience to what I knew, that it made me afraid to read, afraid to ſpeak. And then was it made known to me that the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture killed, becauſe in that knowledge that I had, I thought to have eternal life: And then it was made known to me that my truſting in that knowledge, hindered me of eternal life: And then was it made known to me that the letter of the Scriptures were not the Word of God, nor the power of God to ſalvation: And then was it made known to me the deſire, love, and affection that I had after the Creation, the Creatures, and eſpecially the love to my ſelf, in that what I did in obedience to God, was done for a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end that the Juſtice and Judgments of God might not fall upon me for my ſins, more than it was for any love I had to God: And then was it made known to me that it was my own will that put me upon the doing of all that I did in obedience to God, and in the going from one outward form of Worſhip to another, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended which was beſt, and that God might be beſt pleaſed in. And all this was done for a ſelf-end to eſcape that puniſhment that I apprehended was due to me for my ſins.</p>
               <p>And ſo much was the manifeſtations and making known of Gods Wrath and Juſtice to me for my ſins; and not ſo much for my outward ſins, that men in the world take notice of to be ſin and evil, for ſo all my life I had lived as blameleſs as moſt had done: for now I do know that it was the true Light Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that was in me judging and condemning me for ſuch outward ſins, from my being a very Child; and I was kept from ſuch ſins,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152785:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> as being afraid of Gods Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that was made known to me to be due for ſuch ſins; and yet not ſo kept, but that the ſubtile Serpent ſometimes prevailed over me. And then when I had ſinned, how did I repent, and mourn, and humble my ſelf, and pray to God for forgiveneſs, and ſet upon religious duties, as I was then taught, to gain the love and favour of God! until at laſt theſe Prayers, theſe Mournings, theſe Repentings, theſe Faſtings, theſe Religious Perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mances, became the greateſt ſins in me; and I apprehended Gods Juſtice and Judgments to be moſt due to me for theſe religious ſins, as I may ſo call them, more than I did for any outward profane ſins: for God had made it known to me, that it was the Serpent ſelf in me that put me upon the gaining of underſtanding and knowledge, to know what was Gods will that man ſhould do, thereby to be able to diſcourſe of it amongſt men, and to be counted ſome body; and alſo by that knowledge I thought to have eternal life: And God made it known to me that my love was more to my ſelf in thoſe things that I did in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, than it was from any true love that I had to God; for if I could have eſcaped Gods Juſtice for ſin, I ſhould have loved and delighted more in ſinning than in obeying God: And God made it known to me, that it was my own will, and that for ends that I had of my own, that I did all that I did in gaining and deſiring to gain knowledge of him and of his will. And ſo much was I then grownd in pieces by the ſtone of the manifeſtations, and making known of Gods Juſtice and Judgment d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to me for my religious ſins, as I may ſo call them, as that I was afraid to read, and I dare not pray to God, but ſometimes would fall down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my knees and ſigh and grown, but dare not ſpeak a word, nor dare not ſpeak and diſcourſe of things concerning God, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I had done, nor keep no company with thoſe that were thought to be godly perſons, as before I had done, nor went to no outward form of Worſhip, but ſighed and mourned to my ſelf, but made no outward ſhew of it, for fear I ſhould play the Hypocrite.</p>
               <p>And while I was in this ſtate and condition, what was it that I would not have given for one glympſe or little beam of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known of Gods love to me! which when I was worſhipping and ſerving God, as I thought I was, when in the Serpents ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the underſtanding and knowledge that he had put me upon to gain, and in the obedience that he had put me upon to do, after my Prayers, Mournings, and Repentings, and humbling of my ſelf
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152785:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> for my ſins, and my Promiſes and Vows made to God to do ſo no more; then could I eaſily apprehend God to be a merciful God, forgiving ſins and treſpaſſes, and that God had a love to me: But now when I ſaw that in all theſe religious duties, as I then called them, I found that to be true which often in words I had ſpoken, <hi>That all our Righteouſneſs was but as filthy rag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and as a monſtruous Garment; and that we ſinned in the beſt of our duties and performances.</hi> When I found this to be true indeed, which I had ſo often in formality ſpoken, then there remained in me nothing but a fear of Gods Juſtice and Judgments to follow me for my ſin, and eſpecially for my religious ſins, for my mocking God in a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming outward obedience to him, in doing the outward things that I knew was his will for me to do; but my heart was not upright to God, my love was to my ſin; but for fear of his Juſtice, I dare not commit the ſin: and ſo it was ſelf-will, ſelf-love in me that carried me out in the doing all that I did in obedience to God. And for theſe ſelf-actions in me, I moſt feared Gods Juſtice to fall upon me, and that made me afraid to do or perform any of thoſe religious duties and performances, as I then called them. And thus by the grinding-ſtone of Gods Juſtice, was ſelf in me, in its three parts or properties, that is, in the underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part, in the deſire, love and affection, and in the will; which I in the Parable compare to the three meaſures of Meal, being thus grownd and made fit for the Leaven of Gods love, to be taken in by the woman in me. The drawings or goings forth of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus in me to ſave me from ſin, which now I know was all of his working and preparing, although I did not then underſtand it to be the work of Jeſus in me; but now I know that it was the work of Jeſus in me, to cauſe me to deny my ſelf, to deny my ſelf in that underſtanding and wiſdom that the Serpent put me upon to learn, to deny my ſelf in my love and deſire to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſpecially to that of ſelf in me, and to deny my ſelf in my own will, and eſpecially in the doing of what then I called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious works or Worſhip done to God.</p>
               <p>And while I lay thus grownd apieces, I ſaw nothing in my ſelf to recommend me to God, nor ſaw nothing in my ſelf why God ſhould beſtow any love upon me; nor could I apprehend that there was any love in me to God, as once I could and did apprehend that there was love in me to God, when I was worſhipping him in the Serpents wiſdom, in my own will: Then I thought there
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:152785:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> was a love in me to God, and would ſay ſo too; and would have taken it very ill, if any one ſhould have told me that I did not love God. And while I was in this ſad and deplorable eſtate, without apprehending any love in me to God, or any love in God to me. Now I do know that this was the work of Jeſus the true Light in me, working in me by his ſpirit, to ſave me from ſin; and that not onely from the outward actions of ſin, but to ſave me from the love of ſin. And when he had thus prepared in me, if I may ſo call them, his three meaſures of Meal, the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowing part in me, the Deſire and Love in me, and the Will in me, and made them fit for the woman, the drawings, the leadings and goings forth of the ſpirit of Jeſus in me, to take the Leaven, to take the makings known of the Fathers love to me, then he cauſed it to be ſo to me, then he made known the Fathers love to me.</p>
               <p>And the manner of it was thus: It pleaſed him to bring into my mind the words of <hi>Manoah, Sampſon</hi>'s Father and his Mother, when they ſaw the Angel of the Lord to aſcend up in the flame of the Altar; <hi>Manoah ſaid to his wife, We ſhall ſurely die, becauſe we have ſeen God. But his wife ſaid unto him, If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering, and a meat-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at our hands, neither would he have ſhewed us all theſe things, nor would at this time have told us ſuch things as theſe,</hi> Judg. 13. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thinking of theſe words, God was pleaſed to put this into me, That if God had been pleaſed to kill me, to ſend me to Hell, to damn me, he would never have ſhewed me all theſe things: He would never have ſhewed me the deceit of the ſubtile Serpent ſelf in me, in putting me upon it to get to underſtand and know Gods declared will made known in the Scriptures, (which, as to the letter of them, I knew in that day much more than now I do:) He would never have diſcovered to me the deceit of the Serpent, in putting me upon an outward form of Religion, and from one form to another, which was in beſt eſteem; and that out of a ſelf-love, and not out of any true love that was in me to God: And he would never have diſcovered to me that all this was done in my own will, for ſelf-ends of my own, if God had a mind to kill me, to ſend me to Hell, to damn me: He would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have made known theſe things to me, but have let me go on in the underſtanding and knowledge that the Serpent had put me upon to get, and to let me have contented my ſelf in that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:152785:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> and knowledge, and in that worſhip and ſervice of God that the ſubtile Serpent had put me upon to do in my own will, and ſo have let me gone to Hell in deceiving my ſelf, thinking I had been going to Heaven, and ſhould never have known that I had been going to Hell, until I had been in what is called the flames thereof.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of this, as God would have it, cauſed me to have ſome thoughts that God had ſome love to me, or elſe he would never have made known theſe things to me. And this was but a little Leaven, and a very little too: for I conſidering the greatneſs of my ſins, and eſpecially of my religious ſins (as I now call them) how much I had therein mocked God; and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when he ſaw he could no more deceive me in a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, then he had almoſt got me to deſpair of Gods love, until God dropped in a little hopes of it upon the aforementioned conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but ſo little was this Leav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus as I apprehended the freeneſs of Gods love to me, ſo I found a love to grow in me to God. And that underſtanding and knowledge that the Serpent had perſwaded me to, and that love and deſire to ſelf that he had wrought in me, and that will of my own which before I acted by and did all in, I ſound to be ſo broken and grownd apieces, as not to oppoſe or hinder the working of the Leaven of Gods love in me; but the Leaven of Gods love did ſo work in me, as to work up my heart again unto a love to God.</p>
               <p>And then if at any time any thing of the parts or properties of ſelf did riſe in me, the Light of Jeſus in me diſcovered it, and made it known to me; and by my obedience yielding to the Light in thoſe diſcoverings of ſelf in me, ſelf it was kept under and ſubdued. And ſo as it is the property of the Meal, not to oppoſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152785:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> or hinder the working of the Leaven that it is hid in, but it is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, it ſuffers the Leaven to do its own work; ſo as I kept in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Light in me, which although then I did not know it by that name, but onely by the name of the ſpirit of God in me. I ſay, as I was kept by that power, by the power of the Light or ſpirit of God in me, in obedience to the Light or ſpirit of God in me, which made a diſcovery of the attempts or endeavours of ſelf to riſe again in me; and as I was kept in obedience to that which diſcovered ſelf in me, ſo ſelf was kept down in me in all its three parts or properties; and ſo as ſelf was kept down in me, ſo ſelf oppoſed not the working of the Leaven, the making known of Gods love to me, that wrought in me a love to God again; and ſo as my love increaſed to God, ſo it decreaſed to ſelf in all the three parts or properties of it. And ſo I came to know how to deny my ſelf, and take up the Croſs to that will in me, that is not willing that Gods will ſhould be done in me, and to follow Jeſus, to follow that in me that was in me a ſaving me from ſin. As the Leaven being hid in the Meal, doth not preſently do its work in leavening the whole, but doth it by degrees a little and a little, and in length of time it is that it brings the whole to be like it ſelf; ſo did I then find, as now I do, the Leaven of the love of God made known and hid in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

He ſpake not of himſelf, but the Father that ſent him, he gave him a Commandment what he ſhould ſay, and what he ſhould ſpeak, and he knew his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is life everlaſting; therefore whatſoever he ſpake, it was even as the Father had ſaid to him, ſo he ſpake, <hi>John</hi> 12. 49, 50.

And when there was ſomething that did riſe or get up in that outward body of Jeſus, as the nature of man was in it, that would not have had Gods will to have been done to that body, which that body came to do, which he called his Will: Yet how did he pray to the Father, that that will of his that was not willing to have that done to that body, which that body came to do, that that Will that he called his Will ſhould not be done, but that the Will that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Fathers Will ſhould be done, as you may read in <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi>

               <p>Now as we come to have our wills reſigned and given up into Gods will, ſo we make it appear that we be like Jeſus, that as he in that body that was of the nature of man, had the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to dwell in that body, ſo we in the outward body, that is, in the Nature of man have the Divine Nature to dwell in us; I do not ſay in that meaſure and fulneſs that the Divine Nature dwelt in that body, for the fulneſs of the Divine Nature dwelt in that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and to ſay that the ſeme fulneſs dwells in our bodies, I think to be Blaſphemy: But this I do ſay, that as our wills come to be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152785:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> reſigned and given up to the will of God, ſo we make it appear that we be like Jeſus; that is, as he was in that outward body in the nature of man, and ſo had the Divine Nature to dwell in him; ſo in theſe bodies of ours the Divine Nature dwells in us, that is, a meaſure of the Divine Nature to dwell in us, as Chriſt is the Head, and we the Members of that Body; and ſo as every member of the outward body partakes in its meaſure of the ſame life that is in the head, ſo it is in the ſpiritual or miſtical Body of Jeſus. As we come to haue our wills reſigned and given up into the will of God, ſo we make it appear that we are members of that Body, and that there is a meaſure of the ſame Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to dwell in us, in theſe bodies of ours, that dwelt in that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body of that outward Jeſus; and that according to the meaſure of the ſame Divine Nature dwelling in theſe bodies of ours, ſo we act and do the ſame things that were acted and done by that Body of Jeſus. As the ſame Divine Nature dwells in us, as it takes up its abode and ſtays in us, and remains in us, ſo in theſe bodies of ours are the ſame things acted and done, as was by the ſame Divine Nature acted and done in that Body of Jeſus, wherein the fulneſs of the Divine Nature dwelt: <hi>For in him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily,</hi> Col. 2. 9.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay that the ſame things are acted and done in theſe bodies of ours, wherein this Divine Nature may appear to be in, and their making known that this is the will of God that man ſhould do, and that is the will of God that man ſhould not do; for ſo a meaſure of this Divine Nature is in all men, as he is <hi>the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> John 1. And the World was made by him, and the World knew him not; the World knew him not; and yet they were made by him, and were his own as he was their Creator; and he came to them, as he is the true light in them, but they did not receive him, they would not give him entertainment, they would not let him dwell in them; and therefore it is that the ſame things are not acted and done in them, that was acted and done in the outward Body of Jeſus, and yet he was in them as a light; but to as many as received him, as many as was willing that he ſhould dwell in them, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to them that believed in his Name, even to as many as believed in the power of him, the true light in them, which was the Word, and the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and we beheld
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:152785:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> his Glory, the Glory as of the onely begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth, where a meaſure of the ſame Divine Nature dwells in theſe bodies of ours, that the fulneſs thereof dwelt in that outward body of Jeſus: There is a beholding of it, a ſeeing of it as the Glory of the onely begotten of the Father in them, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. I ſay, that where the will is reſigned and given up into the will of God, there it does make it appear that we are like Jeſus; that as the Divine Nature was in that outward body of Jeſus, and dwelt there, and in that outward body it did the will of God the Father, ſo a meaſure of the ſame Divine Nature is in theſe bodies of ours, and dwells there, and in theſe bodies of ours do the will of God the Father, as it did in that body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p>And as Jeſus did nothing of himſelf, but as the Father taught him; and as the Father taught him, ſo he ſpake thoſe things that he ſpake. So as our wills come to be reſigned and given up into the will of God, we will do nothing of our ſelves; there will be a denying of all ſelf, and a doing onely of ſuch things as the Father teacheth us, and then there will be a denying of our ſelves in all we ſpeak, and a ſpeaking of nothing but what the Father teacheth us to ſpeak; and therefore men may know by their actions and by their words, whether in their actions and words their wills be reſigned and given up to God, and ſo thereby they may know whether a meaſure of the ſame Divine Nature dwells in that body of theirs, that dwelt in that body of Jeſus. When men do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what God the Father teacheth them to do, and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what God the Father teacheth them to ſay, then they make it appear, that their wills are reſigned and given up into Gods will, and what is done, and what is ſpoken in them, is done and ſpoken by a meaſure of the ſame Divine Nature dwelling in them, that dwelt in that body of Jeſus; and ſo they make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they in theſe bodies be like to what Jeſus was in that body. But when men do ſuch things as God the Father does not teach them to do, and ſpeak ſuch words as God the Father does not teach them to ſpeak, they then make it appear, that in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things, and ſpeaking of thoſe words, that their wills are not reſigned and given up to Gods will; nor are thoſe things done, nor thoſe words ſpoken by a meaſure of the ſame Divine
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:152785:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> Nature dwelling in them, that dwelt in that outward body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, but thoſe things that were done in them, were ſuch as that God did not teach them to do, and thoſe words ſpoken by them, were ſuch as that God did not teach them to ſpeak: Thoſe works were done by them in their own Wills, and thoſe words ſpoken by them, were ſpoken in their own Wills.</p>
               <p>Jeſus he ſpake nothing of himſelf, but as the Father that ſent him, gave him a Command what he ſhould ſay, and what he ſhould ſpeak, and he knew that his Command was life everlaſting, and therefore what he ſpake was even as the Father had ſaid to him. So as our wills come to be reſigned and given up to the Will of God, we will ſpeak nothing of our ſelves, but as God our Father giveth us a Command what we ſhall ſay, and what we ſhall ſpeak; and we know that his Command is life everlaſting; and therefore what the Father gives in Command to ſpeak, even ſo as the Father hath ſaid, ſo to ſpeak. And where there is a knowing of what God hath given in Command to ſpeak, and that in this Command there is life everlaſting; and then where there hath not been a ſpeaking of what God hath given in Command, there the Will hath not been reſigned, nor given up into the Will of God; nor hath it there been made appear, that the ſame Divine Nature dwelt in that body, that dwelt in the body of Jeſus; but in their own Wills, in the Earthy part in them, they have hid the Command of God in them, that he hath given them to ſpeak: And therefore as man ought not to ſpeak any thing in his own Will, ſo man in his will ought not to hide or keep in ſilence any thing that God hath given him in Command to ſpeak, let it be never ſo little, or never ſo much: And as it is mans duty to obey Gods Command in ſpeaking, ſo man ought alſo to have a care in going beyond Gods Command in ſpeaking, for that is not to be like Jeſus, who ſpake even as the Father had ſaid to him, to ſpeak juſt ſo much, neither more nor leſs.</p>
               <p>And as Jeſus did manifeſt and make known to the World the love he had to the Father, in that whatſoever the Father gave him in Command, even ſo he did: ſo where the Will is reſigned and given up to the Will of God, there is a making of it appear, that we in theſe bodies be like as Jeſus was in that body; in that we make known and make manifeſt to the World that we love God the Father, and that we make it appear to them that we love God as our Father, in that we keep his Commands, and that we keep
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152785:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> his Commands from a principle of love, as Jeſus did, we do not only make it appear to the world, that we do thoſe things that God requires of us to do, but we do them becauſe we love God, and we love him as our Father. There be thoſe that as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in an outward obedience, they do the things that God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but they do not do them becauſe they love God as a Father, but becauſe they are afraid of Gods Juſtice or Judgments that they have a knowledge of that will fall upon them, if they do not do the things that God Commands them to do; and therefore it is that they do the things that God Commands them, out of a fear, and not from a principle of Love to God: And by this we may know how far our wills are reſigned and given up into the Will of God, by what it is that works in us the doings of the Commands of God. If that which puts us upon the doing of the things that God hath required of us to do, is becauſe we are afraid of God, afraid of Gods Juſtice or Judgments to fall upon us, which the light in us tells us is juſtly due to us for the breaking Gods Command, then it is our own Will in us that puts us upon the doing of thoſe things that God Commands us to do, becauſe we would eſcape the puniſhment; and this our obedience is not done becauſe we love God, but becauſe we love our ſelves: But when the Will comes to be reſigned and given up into Gods Will, then there is a doing of Gods Commands, not becauſe we are afraid of Gods Juſtice or Judgments to fall upon us if we do not do them, but becauſe we love God as a Father, and that was that from whence the Divine Nature in that body of Jeſus did the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, it was becauſe there was a love in that Divine Nature which did the Commands of God in that body, as God was its Father, as God was he that begat that Divine Nature in that body.</p>
               <p>When I ſpeak of God as a Father, begetting the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that body, I do not believe that there is a ſeparation in the Divine Nature it ſelf, or that there is degrees of Age in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature it ſelf, as that which begets is before that which is begotten, but I believe it is all one God, all one Divine Nature, all one Being, which giveth Being to all; but this I believe, that there is a diſtance or degrees of time, wherein this Divine Nature manifeſts or makes known it ſelf to man his Creature, as in the Creation he made known himſelf to be in man, as his Creator and Maker of him in his own Image; and not onely ſo, but the words
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152785:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Scripture are <hi>in our Image,</hi> in the Image that the Divine Nature would make known it ſelf to man in, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: And man by his diſobedience loſt this Image of God, and then God was pleaſed to make known himſelf to be in man, as a begetter of his likeneſs in man; and that which is the begotten likeneſs of God in man, that is called the begotten Son of God.</p>
               <p>And in that body of Jeſus, God (the Divine Nature) begot ſo much of the Divine Likeneſs, as to keep that body from being overcome by the Devils Temptations (as <hi>Adam</hi> was overcame in that created body wherein God had made his Image; and this is a myſtery, to know the difference between the created Image and likeneſs of God, and the begotten Image and likeneſs of God. Man in the created Image and likeneſs of God, by the ſubrilty of the Serpents Temptations, fell and ſinned, and the begotten Image of God in man that cannot ſin.) God cauſed the fulneſs of the Godhead to dwell bodily in that body of Jeſus: That body was ſo filled with God, with the Divine Nature, that there was no part of the body which was not filled, which was not filled full of the Divine Nature, and ſo the fulneſs of the Godhead may be ſaid to dwell in that body bodily; and ſo God is pleaſed to make known himſelf in ſuch ways, and by ſuch means, as he hath been pleaſed to make man capable to underſtand that of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo much of it as is his good pleaſure that man ſhould underſtand of the Divine Nature; and by Gods making known of the Divine Nature, to beget that of the Divine Nature in that body of Jeſus, that did the Will of the Divine Nature in that body, and in that body it did nothing elſe but the Will of the Divine Nature; ſo God is pleaſed thereby to make known in us his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting in theſe bodies of ours that of the Divine Nature, his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us in theſe bodies of ours, that do the Will of God, and that it do nothing elſe in us but the Will of God, that is the Divine Nature by which God begets his likeneſs in us, which Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is that which does the Will of God in us, and it does nothing elſe in us but the Will of God, as it did in Jeſus the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God: And as we are begotten by the Divine Nature, ſo are we members of that onely begotten Son of God; and ſo we do nothing but what is Gods Will. And ſo as our Wills come to be reſigned and given up into the Will of God, then there will be a doing of the Commands of God, as we love him as he is a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152785:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> Father, that in theſe bodies of ours, it is he that begot this divine nature in us, by which we come to do his Commands. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we manifeſt and make known to the world, that we in theſe bodies of ours, are according to the meaſure of the working of that divine nature in us working in us, to reſigne and give up our wills to the will of God, like as Jeſus was in that body.</p>
               <p>And when there was ſomething that did riſe and get up in that outward body of Jeſus, as the nature of man was in that body that would not have had Gods will to have been done in that body, which that body came to do, which he called his will; yet ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led full of the divine nature was that body, as that there was no room in it to give it entertainment, as appeareth by that earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he prayed to the Father, that that will of his, as he was man, that was not willing to have that done to that body, which that body came to do, that that which he called his will, that was his will as he was man, ſhould not be done; but that will that he called the Fathers will, ſhould not be done. And as we come to have our wills reſigned and given up into the will of God, as Father, according to that meaſure that our wills are reſigned and given up to the will of God, ſo do we make it appear, that we in theſe bodies are like to what Jeſus was in that body. And then as any thing doth riſe and get up in us, as we are men that would not that that ſhould come to theſe bodies of ours, or to any outward thing that we call ours, let it be what it will; and if it be any thing that we look upon as ours, or that we have any intereſt in, and would not that Gods will ſhould be done in it or to it; and that not onely Gods declared will given in command for man to do, but that which may be called Gods will of ſufferance, as God ſuffers things to come to paſs, which are contrary to Gods decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red will; as God ſuffered falſe witneſſes to be brought againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and he ſuffered the Jews to be envious againſt him, and out of envy to bring him before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and deſired him to crucifie him, although he found no fault in him, and he accordingly paſſed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon him, and they executed the ſentence upon him. All this was done to Jeſus, contrary to Gods declared will for man to do in obedience to God. Man was not to bear falſe witneſs, nor do any thing out of envy, or to paſs ſentence of death upon the innocent, nor to take away the life of the innocent.</p>
               <p>And yet the Apoſtle tells the Jews, <hi>Acts 2. 23. Him, being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the determinate counſel, and foreknowledge of God, ye have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152785:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> So that there is nothing that does befal theſe bodies of ours, or to any outward thing that we call ours, but that may be ſaid to be as God will have it ſo to be, either as it is his will given in command to be done, or as it is his will of ſufferance, as that was his will of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance in ſuffering of the Jews to put Jeſus to death. And there was a will that did riſe and get up in that body Jeſus, as he was man, that deſired if it were poſſible, that hour might paſs from him; but there was another will in him, as the divine nature dwelt in him, that would not that that will of his that would have had the hour to paſs from him, and the Cup taken from him, that would not have that will be done, but the Fathers will be done, whoſe will it was that he ſhould drink of the Cup; and that hour ſhould come upon him: By which it doth appear, that there is nothing that does befal our bodies, or to what we call ours, that is, as to the outward things, but there is a will of the Father in it.</p>
               <p>Now as our wills in all things, whatſoever it is that does befal us, be reſigned and given up into the Will of God, as our Father; ſo do we make it appear, that the divine nature dwells in us, and that in theſe bodies we are like Jeſus, as he was in that body. And wherein our Wills are not reſigned and given up into the Will of God, in whatſoever it is that does befal theſe bodies of ours, or any thing that we call ours, there we make it appear that we are not in theſe bodies of ours, like to Jeſus in that body; and therein we make it appear that we have not taken up our Croſs to our Wills; and therein we make it appear, that we are no Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, no Follower, no Learner of Jeſus in us; but we are therein a Diſciple, a Follower, a Learner of our own Wills in us. And this is the daily work that the Diſciples, the Followers, the Learners of Jeſus ſhould do, that is, to take up his Croſs to his own Will, and follow Jeſus, in reſigning and giving up his Will into the Will of God his Father. And no more than we can make it appear, that we are thus daily taking up our Croſs, in reſigning and giving up our Wills into the Will of God, as a Father; no more can man make it appear, that he is a Diſciple, a Follower, a Learner of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus within him. Let man profeſs what Religion he will, know what he will, live never ſo blameleſs, as to the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of men, eſteem of himſelf as he will, and let him be never ſo great in the eſteem of others; yet no more than he can make it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:152785:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> appear, that he hath taken up his Croſs to his Will, and reſigned and given up his Will into the Will of God, as his Father, no more can he make it appear that he is a Diſciple, a Follower, a Learner of Jeſus within him, that is in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſave him from ſin. Nor can he any more make it appear, that he in that outward body of his is like what Jeſus was in that outward body in which the divine nature dwelt in; nor can he make it appear, that the divine nature dwells in him, as it dwelt in that outward body of Jeſus, but onely as his Will is, as Jeſus's Will was reſigned and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up into the Will of God, as his Father.</p>
               <p>The reſigning and giving up of the will into the will of God, as a Father, this is to eat Jeſus's fleſh, and drink his bloud, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the doing thereof, we have no life in us; and this is that Bread that came down from Heaven: and did not come down from Heaven to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him, <hi>John.</hi> 6. This is that Meat that Jeſus had to eat, that his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples knew not of; which Meat was to do the will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his work, <hi>John</hi> 4. 32, 34. This is that, which <hi>when it cometh into the world, ſaith, Sacrifices and offerings thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me. Then ſaid I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10. This is that which cometh into the world, <hi>Man,</hi> that pleaſeth God better than outward Sacrifices or Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; it is that which doth the will of God in man, that pleaſeth God better than outward Sacrifices and Offerings. This is the body that God the Father prepares. This is his begotten Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in man, that ſaves from ſin, that which doth Gods will in man, and thereby cauſes man to reſigne and give up his will into the will of God as his Father, and ſo take up his Croſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Diſciple, a Follower, a Learner of Jeſus, in him that ſaves him from ſin.</p>
               <p>The reſigning and giving up of the will into Gods will, as a Father, This is that which worketh contentedneſs in all ſtates and conditions. This is that which maketh Chriſts burden light, and his yoke eaſie. This is that by which we come to know that all things worketh together for good, to them that love God. This is that which maketh chaſtiſements, although at preſent they ſeem grievous, yet afterwards they yield the peaceable fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them that are exerciſed therein. This is the Feaſt of fat things, and of Wine well refined from the lees, that God hath

               <p>The reſigning and giving up of the will into the will of God, was that in which the Faith of thoſe mentioned in the 11th of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> was exerciſed in.

And in the having of the will reſigned and given up into the will of God, this gives true peace, true quietneſs, true comfort, true content, and true ſatisfaction in the enjoyment of what, as man, we deſire to enjoy: And in the having of the will reſigned and given up into the will of God, this giveth true peace, true quiet, true comfort, true content and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the bearing and ſuffering under thoſe things that do befal us, and come to us, or upon us, that are contrary to the deſire and will of man in us.</p>
               <p>And would man, as God hath made him more reaſonable, and hath placed more of Reaſon in him, than in all the Creatures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; would he but conſult with this Reaſon in him, and be true to the Light of God in him, he would ſee how reaſonable a thing it is for him to reſigne and give up his Will into the Will of God. And if man did firſt conſider the great care and love that God took, I ſpeak after the manner of men, as God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture compares himſelf, and his actions to man, and to the actions of men, and ſo after that manner, I call it the great care and love that God did take in the creating and making of Man, more than in all other things that he made: In all other things that he made, he did but ſay, Let there be, and there was; as he ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light:</hi> And ſo on in the whole Creation it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152785:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> is, <hi>And God ſaid;</hi> and as God ſaid, ſo it was, until he came to make Man; and then God ſaid, <hi>Let us make man:</hi> Although the word <hi>us</hi> ſignifies more than one, yet do I not believe that there is more than one God, but God ſpeaking after the manner of men, calls in the advice or aſſiſtance of the whole Divine Nature that he would make himſelf known to man in, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, which he did not in all or any part of the Creation before, and further he did not in all or any of the Creation before (man being the laſt of the Creation) He did not ſay, Let us make it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our likeneſs; but in the Creation of man, he ſaid, <hi>Let us make man in our likeneſs:</hi> And ſo God created man in his own Image. And God did not ſay that he created any thing but man in his likeneſs and Image. And moreover; God did not give to any Creature that he had made (except man) the Dominion over any other Creature; but to man God gave the Dominion over the fiſh of the Sea, and over the fowl of the Air, and over the cattel, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152785:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> that would make known to man in that reaſon that God hath given to man, That if man did not reſign and give up his will into the will of God, he would in the not doing of it, ſhew and manifeſt an exceeding deal of Unworthineſs, Unthankfulneſs, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and Rebellion againſt God, who might very juſtly and reaſonably require and command of man to have his will reſigned and given up into his will, for the great love and care that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and made known to man above all other of his Creation, in making of man in his likeneſs and Image, and the Dominion that he gave him above what he gave to all other of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>And if the conſideration of Gods love to man in his Creation, will not work upon man by the true light of God in him, to the reaſonableneſs that it is for man to reſign and give up his will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods will, then let man conſider the unchangeableneſs of Gods love to man, in that although God had manifeſted and made known ſo great love to man, in his creating and making of him, more than to any or all the Creatures that he made beſides man; and yet notwithſtanding this great love that God hath ſhewed to man, in making of him in his likeneſs and Image, yet man proved ſo unworthy and rebellious to this God that manifeſted and made known ſo much love to him, as that he rebelled againſt this God, and as I may ſay, to ſpeak after the manner of men, proved a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to this God that had manifeſted and made known ſo much love to him: For whereas God in the Creation, as man was made in his Image, God ruled in man, and over man, and mans will was reſigned and given up into the will of God: But man like a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſet up his own will, and preferred that above and before the will of God in him, and put the government of himſelf under his own will, to be ruled by his own will, where all men in the fallen ſtate now are; and while this will bears the rule over them, they will not come to Jeſus the true Light in them, that they may have life, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. And although man in his Treachery and Rebellion, loſt his love to God, and became an enemy to God, yet God as unchangeable he continued his love to man, and his love was then ſo great to man, when man was in his Rebellion againſt God, and an enemy to God, that he gave his onely begotten Son, <hi>that whoſoever believed in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>And God commended his love towards us, that while we were yet ſinners,</hi> and enemies to God, <hi>Chriſt died for us,</hi>

               <p>And what, ſhall not the unchangeableneſs of Gods Love to us, and the willingneſs that is in God that we ſhould be reconciled to him, and not to periſh? ſhall not this work upon us to be willing to reſign and give up our wills into Gods will, when there can be no reconciliation made between God and loſt man, but by mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to reſign and give up his will into the will of God? That is the partition-wall that muſt be taken down, that which at firſt made the ſeparation between God and man. It was man went out of the doing of Gods will, into the doing of his own will; and to reconcile man again to God, there muſt be a going out of mans will into Gods will again. And is not this very reaſonable, that man ſhould reſign and give up his will into the will of God, being Gods love is ſo unchangeable to man? As that when man had no true love in him to God, but was Gods enemy, yet then Gods love was ſuch to man, as to give his Son, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, to keep man from periſhing, and that man by his love of God might have everlaſting life: and therefore can there be any thing more reaſonable than this, That man ſhould reſign and give up his will into the will of God.</p>
               <p>And further, if the conſideration of Gods love to man in his Creation, and the unchangeableneſs of his love to man when man was turned Gods enemy, and Gods willingneſs to have man to be reconciled unto him; if this will not prevail with man to be willing to have his will reſigned and given up into the will of God, let man conſider the abſolute neceſſity that there is as on mans part to have his will reſigned and given up into Gods will; for if mans will be not reſigned and given up into Gods will, man peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes for ever. There can be no reconciling of God and man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without mans will being reſigned and given up into the will of God; for although indeed God is unchangeable in himſelf, and ſo is a God of love, and ſo there is love in God to man his Creature, yet alſo God in himſelf is a God of Juſtice, executing of his Juſtice to all, and upon all, that ſtand it out in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; which all men do while in their wills they oppoſe Gods will: And let men flatter themſelves what they will with the unchangeableneſs of Gods love to man, and ſo have thoughts that God loves them, yet until there is a willingneſs in them to have their wills reſigned and given up into the will of God, I know
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152785:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> by experience that theſe thoughts of theirs of Gods loving of them, is changeable in them; and ſometimes they may have thoughts in them that God loves them, and at other times they are afraid of Gods Juſtice and Judgments to fall upon them for their ſins and tranſgreſſions. And to be made free from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations or making known of Gods Juſtice and Judgments for ſin in us, and to us, is to have our wills reſigned and given up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of God, and then we may ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>For that which I do, I allow not, for what I would, that I do not; but what I hate that I do. If then I do that which I would not, I conſent unto the law that it is good; now then it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the will comes to be reſigned and given up into the will of God, ſo there is a knowing that there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit; there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, to them whoſe wills are reſigned and given up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of God, as their Father, as was the will of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and there is no being in Chriſt Jeſus, unleſs in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, degree or other the will be reſigned and given up to God, as a Father, as was the will of Chriſt Jeſus: And as their wills are reſigned and given up into the will of God, ſo they walk not after the fleſh, they walk not after their fleſhly wills, they follow not their fleſhly wills, but they walk after the ſpirit, they follow after the ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus the true light in them, that teacheth them to reſign and give up their wills into the will of God; and thoſe who are not thus in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who have not their wills reſigned and given up into the will of God, as Chriſt Jeſus will was, they are ſtill in the ſtate of condemnation, becauſe they walk after the fleſh, their own wills; and although at ſometimes they may have ſome hopes or apprehenſions of Gods love towards them, yet it is not laſting in them, it fails them when they ſtand in moſt need of it; that is, it fails them when God is making known in them and to them his Juſtice and Judgments due to them for their ſins: Then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend any love in God to them, but they are afraid of God, for then they cannot ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, that <hi>what I would I do not; but what I hate, that I do;</hi> and then that <hi>it was no more I that did it, but ſin that dwelleth in me:</hi> They cannot ſpeak after that manner, but inſtead thereof, the light of God in them tells
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152785:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> them, that the ſins that God is manifeſting and making known his Juſtice and Judgments againſt them for, is for ſuch ſins as that they would do; it is for ſuch ſins as they were willing to do it is for ſuch ſins as they had a love and deſire to do; and therefore the Condemnation is upon them for ſuch ſins as they were willing to do, and had a love to do. And in this ſtate as they lye under the ſentence of Condemnation for their ſins willingly done in them, and by them, they can ſee no love in God to them; although at another time it may be they may think that God loves them, when although in their own wills it is that they are yielding an outward obedience to God; yet this apprehenſion of Gods love to them, becauſe of their yielding an outward obedience to God, it is not laſting in them: And why is it not laſting in them? it is becauſe their wills are not reſigned and given up into the will of God; but as ſoon as the Serpent by his ſubtilty draws them into diſobedience to God, then there riſes in them an apprehenſion of Gods anger, and a making known of Gods Juſtice to them for their ſins, which remain in them, until by the Serpents ſubtilty he ſometimes puts ſome of them upon it, to go into merry company, as they call it, and ſo much as in them lyeth, by their vain mirth they ſlay the witneſs of God in them, and make merry over it; and ſo for a time they get off or over that fear and dread that was in them of Gods Juſtice for their ſins; and if this will not do to get off the fear and dread of Gods Juſtice for ſin, as in many it will not, then the ſubtile Serpent he puts them upon repentings, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, mournings, humbling of themſelves, faſting and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and it may be vows to do ſo no more; and then upon theſe their doings and performing of worſhip and ſervice to God, as they call it, then it may be they can apprehend ſome love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from God to them; but as ſoon again as the guilt of ſin falls upon them, and God ſets home upon them his Juſtice and Judgments due to them for their ſins, then inſtead of beholding love in God towards them, they apprehend anger and wrath in God towards them for their ſins; and ſo they make God as changeable in his love to them, as they are changeable in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God; and ſo they in that ſtate cannot come to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge that there is a reconcilement made between God and them: And why? becauſe their wills are not reſigned and given up into the will of God; but what obedience is done in them to God, is done in their own wills, and not in the will of God: And from thence it is that when they fail in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152785:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> to God, they fail in their apprehending love in God to them; and why? becauſe all that is done in them is done in their own wills.</p>
               <p>And if the conſideration of the neceſſity that is in man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and give up his will into the will of God, to keep man from periſhing, if this will not do to cauſe man to be willing to reſign and give up his will into the will of God, then let them conſider, that the ſame God that was and is able of <hi>ſtones to raiſe up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto Abraham,</hi> Matth. 3. 9. that this God in his infinite power was able to have left man in that dreadful ſtate of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual lying under the manifeſtations and making known of his Juſtice and Judgments to man for his ſins, without ever having any hopes of Gods love to him: And in that infinite power of his he might have beſtowed the riches of his Love upon ſome other Creature, and that this infinite God in his infinite power ſhould not leave man for ever, under the apprehenſions and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known of his Juſtice and Judgments to him for his ſins, and to be without all hopes of ever receiving any love from that God, that he had ſo offended by his ſins. But that this infinite God, inſtead of his thus leaving man in that dreadful ſtate, as was in his power ſo to do. He in this infinite power hath notwithſtanding all mans ill-deſerving at his hands, which in illneſs and badneſs of deſert, man hath deſerved worſe at Gods hands than all the Creatures beſides, becauſe to none of the Creatures God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted ſo much love and care in the creating of them, as he did to man, and no Creature hath rebelled more againſt God than man hath done, and yet for this infinite God, who in his infinite power might ſo juſtly have left man in that moſt miſerable ſtate, and might have beſtowed the riches of his Love upon ſome other Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and inſtead thereof he without any deſert on mans part, and without any deſire in man. For this great God ſo freely to beſtow his infinite and unchangeable love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man his ſo unworthy and rebellious Creature, and ſo great love as he beſtows not the like love upon any of the Creation: And all that is deſired or required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of man for his being made ſure of this great and infinite unchangeable love of God, is but for man to be willing to reſign and give up his will into the will of this infinite loving God, to be ruled and guided and governed by the will of this infinite loving God, as the will of this infinite lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God is made known in him and to him; man need not to ſay, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, to bring Gods will down from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152785:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> thence, that he may know what is Gods will for him to do? Or who ſhall go down into the deep, to bring Gods will from thence, that he may know Gods will for him to do? No there is no need of that: for the Word, the true Light Jeſus, that makes known what is God, the Fathers will for man to do in obedience to him, <hi>is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart,</hi> Rom. 10. 8. and that is the word that the Apoſtles preached, that man ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey God in.</p>
               <p>And this great work of obedience to this great loving God, this great loving God is willing to work himſelf in man, unto himſelf: And all that is required or deſired of man, is but to be like the Meal that doth not hinder or oppoſe the working of the Leaven in it, to change and alter the Meal, and make it like the Leaven. And what, ſhall not the conſideration of this infinite and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love of God, ſo freely offered and tendered to man, that hath been ſo unworthy, ſo treacherous, and ſo rebellious againſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite loving Power, who is willing to give and to make to man a full and firm aſſurance of this his unchangeable love to them, and require nothing elſe of man for the doing thereof, but a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for man to reſigne and give up his Will into the Will of this infinite loving God, to be ruled, guided, and governed by the Will of this loving God? And this great loving God is willing to do it for him and in him, (to ſpeak after the manner of men, without putting him to any charge or trouble in bringing the work to paſs) and that freely, if man would not in his Will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and hinder God in this his great work. And what will man, whom God hath endued with more Reaſon than he hath all the Creatures upon the Earth, will he be ſo ruinous and deſtructive to himſelf, as not to be willing to reſigne and give up his Will into the Will of God, to be ruled, guided, and governed by the Will of God made known in him and to him; and that when this great, infinite, and unchangeable loving God is willing to do that great work in him, of working up of mans Will into the Will of God, if man would not oppoſe him in this his great work? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may it not well be ſaid of man, that his deſtruction is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               <p>And laſtly, I deſire man to conſider, that if he will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the making known of the unchangeableneſs of Gods love to him, by Jeſus the Son of God, the true Light in him, to have his will to be reſigned and given up into the will of God,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152785:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> and by Gods willingneſs to do this great work in him, yet at length Gods will ſhall and will be done; and man, in and by his will, cannot nor ſhall not hinder Gods will from being done. Do we not ſee it by daily experience, how God makes void and brings to nought the purpoſes that man in his will determines to bring to paſs? yea, the purpoſes and determinations of the great men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, made in their wills, how in their wills they can go no further, nor do no more than God in his will of ſufferance ſuffers them ſo to do? And come to more inferiour men of all ſorts and degrees, how they in their wills purpoſe and appoint the doing of this or that thing, and how by God their purpoſes and appointments are made void, and come to nothing; and cannot in any of them go or do the leaſt, beyond the will of. Gods ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſuffer them to go or do. Neither can men in their wills, by all the means that they can uſe, keep or hinder from falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or from falling upon any thing that they call theirs; or hinder the coming upon them, or upon any thing that they call theirs; any thing whatſoever that God in his will intends and purpoſes ſhall fall upon them or theirs, or any thing that ſhall come upon them or upon what they call theirs.</p>
               <p>And although man for a time may hinder Gods will, that is, Gods declared will that man ſhould obey God in, this will of God man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may by his diſobedience hinder from being done in him, yet at length Gods will will be done in them whether man will or no; that is, Gods will in Gods adminiſtration of his Juſtice and true Judgment in man for his diſobedience againſt God. And that man by all the ways and means that man in his will can uſe, he cannot nor ſhall not hinder that will of God from being done in him. And therefore according to true Reaſon, as God hath made man a reaſonable Creature, above all the Creatures upon the Earth, what madneſs and folly is it for man to ſtand in his own will, and not to become willing by the power of Jeſus the true Light in him, to reſigne and give up his will into the will of God, and take up his Croſs to his own will, and to be a Diſciple, a Follower, a Learner of Jeſus in him, who is in him to that very end, to ſave him from ſin, and to reconcile him to God.</p>
               <p>All that is required for man to do, in the reſigning and giving up of his will into Gods will, is but to be as the Meal is to the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not to oppoſe God in his work in man, as the Meal does not oppoſe or hinder the working of the Leaven. So man in his will
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:152785:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> is not to oppoſe or hinder God in his work in him, in the making known his love in man and to man, and thereby to work a love in man to God again; and to work out of man that love that is in man to his own underſtanding and knowledge, to his own deſire, love, and affection, and to his own will: for as man by the ſpirit of Jeſus in him, receives and takes in the love of God unto him, not as a righteous perſon, as if he deſerved love at Gods hands, but as a ſinner, an enemy to God; and ſo as that there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert in him that God ſhould ſhew any love to him, but as to deſert in him, his deſert it is to have Gods Juſtice and Judgment to fall upon him for his ſins: Jeſus calls not the righteous, but ſinners to repentance; and man does not repent of the love that he hath to ſin, but as he comes to apprehend love in God to him, as a ſinner; (man may for fear of Gods Juſtice, repent of the actions of ſin, but not of the love he hath to ſin.) And in this ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for man to be brought to apprehend love in God to him, as a ſinner, as an enemy to God, although God does not love ſin in man, yet God loves man as his Creature. And this love in God begets a love in man to God, and from that love that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by God in man to God: for it is God that begets the love in man to himſelf, and by that love man comes to obey God, becauſe God firſt loved him: And then man, according to that meaſure or degree of love that is begot in him by God, he becomes a nothing in himſelf, that God may be all and do all in him. And then is man as the Meal, not oppoſing the working of the Leaven of Gods love in him bringing him to love God again: And ſo man then does all that he does, in obedience to God, beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>I hope none will deny but that this was a man truly ſent of God, and his Meſſage was true, and proved true; but becauſe he did not continue in his obedience to the Command that God had given to him, he was ſlain by a Lion. As he was commanded to cry againſt <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> an Altar ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> under a pretence to worſhip God, but not in the way that God had appointed; ſo he was alſo commanded not to eat bread, nor drink water in that place. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> as a King, threatning of him for crying out againſt the Altar which God had commanded him to cry out againſt, in <hi>that he put forth his hand ſaying, Lay hold on him,</hi> that did not in the leaſt prevail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with him to diſobey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; neither could the ſhew of friendſhip and kindneſs, although from a King, prevail with him to break the Command of God. The King ſaid unto the man of God, <hi>Come home with me and refreſh thy ſelf, and I will give thee a reward. And the man of God ſaid unto the King, If thou wilt give me half thy houſe, I will not go with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place: for ſo it was charged me by the word of the Lord; ſaying, Eat no bread, nor drink no water, nor turn again by the ſame way thou comeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray mark! Neither the threatning of a King, nor the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and kindneſs offered by a King, could not in the leaſt prevail with the man of God to diſobey God in any part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given him by God: And yet he was prevailed with to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Command of God, and for his diſobedience it coſt him his life. And I pray obſerve how he was prevailed with: An old Prophet that dwelt in <hi>Bethel,</hi> where he was to cry againſt the Altar ſet up under a pretence of worſhipping of God, but not as God was to be worſhipped, and this old Prophet he pretended that he was a Prophet, as the man of God was that cried againſt the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152785:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and that an Angel ſpake to him by the Word of the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Bring him back with thee into thine houſe, that he may eat bread and drink water: but he lyed unto him.</hi> I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what was the outward ruine of this man of God, that was ſent by God to cry againſt the Altar that was ſet up under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of worſhipping God; the cauſe it was that he departed from obeying the true Command that he in himſelf knew and believed that God had given to him, and he believed the lye that the old Prophet told him, that he had in command given to him by an Angel ſpeaking to him by the Word of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thus much is clear ſet forth in the Scripture, that I have often read without me. Now ſhall I ſpeak ſomething of what I know of this Scripture within me: for no Scripture is of any private interpretation; as there is the letter of it without, ſo there is the myſtery of it to be known within. I did and do know that men and women may make a great ſhew of an outward form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and yet deny the power thereof, by the not yielding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to what they know of God. And how ready they are, by the ſubtilty of the Serpent, to be deceived in that they have a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is Gods will that they ſhould do, and what is Gods will that they ſhould not do; and from that knowledge that they have of God, they ſet up to themſelves an outward form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God, and are ready with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who ſaid of the Calves that he had made, <hi>Behold thy gods, O Iſrael, that brought thee out of Egypt.</hi> So are men and women, in the underſtanding and knowing part that they have of God, by the ſubtilty of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in them, they are ready to ſet up or ſet upon an outward form of worſhipping God, according as they are led thereunto by their own wills, for ends of their own, (as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, who in his own will ſet up the Calves, and that for a ſelf-end of his own, which was to keep the people from going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip God, leſt by their going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip God, he ſhould loſe his Kingdom) and they are ready to ſay, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, <hi>Behold thy gods that brought thee out of Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> ſignifies ſlavery and bondage, which men ſpiritually lieth in, while ſin hath the rule and dominion over them; and while they lie under the manifeſtations or makings known of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Judgments to them for their ſins, they look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the ſlavery and bondage to ſin, becauſe then they are ſenſible of ſins ruling over them; but when they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:152785:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> can get off the manifeſtations or making known of Gods Juſtice to them for their ſins, and are brought into an outward obedience to God, in doing the outward things that God hath commanded them to do, then they look upon themſelves to be brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the ſlavery and bondage to ſin, although the love and deſire to ſin remains in them as live as ever it was: And ſo ſin, in the love and deſire to it, rules over them as much as ever it did; but they dare not, for fear of Gods wrath, the manifeſtations and making known of Gods Juſtice and Judgments for ſin; it is that which keeps them from ſin: And they do not forſake ſin for any love that is in them to God, or for any diſlike that is in them to ſin, but for a ſelf-love that is to themſelves, becauſe they would eſcape the puniſhment that they know is due to them for their ſins. And from this ſelf-love that they have to themſelves to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape Gods Juſtice and Judgments for their ſins, they ſet up their Calves, they ſet up an outward form of Worſhip, (let it be what outward form of Worſhip it will, it is but as <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Calves) becauſe it is not the Worſhip that God requires and accepts of: for God is a Spirit, and requires to be ſpiritually worſhipped; and he accepts of no other Worſhip, but what is the Worſhip of his own Spirit in man, done from a principle of love to God: And whatſoever Worſhip man in his will ſets up, becauſe he would eſcape the Juſtice and Judgments of God for his ſins, is no Worſhip acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>And this I do know, that when men are in this Worſhip, ſet up in their own wills to eſcape the puniſhment of God for their ſins, they ſay in their hearts, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſaid outwardly of his Calves, <hi>Behold thy gods that brought thee out of Egypt;</hi> Behold this Worſhip that I in my will have ſet up or taken up to keep me from the apprehenſions of Gods Juſtice and Judgments to me; it hath delivered me, it hath brought me out from that ſlavery and bondage that I was in under the apprehenſions of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known of Gods wrath, Gods Juſtice and Judgments to me for my ſins. And now they ſet up an Altar to theſe the Calves that they have made, that is, their own outward obedience done in their own wills, for their own ends; and upon this Altar they offer their Sacrifices, they offer their outward performances of their outward religious duties, or their outward ſervice in the worſhip of their Calves, in worſhipping and bowing down to that outward form of Worſhip that in their wills they have ſet up,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:152785:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> thereby to eſcape Gods Juſtice and Judgments that they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be due to them for their ſins. And although for a time they may hereby patch up a peace to themſelves, yet it is no more laſting to them, than <hi>Adam</hi>'s Aprons made of Fig-leaves, were laſting to him: for as ſoon as he heard Gods voice walking in the garden, although in the cool of the day, he was afraid and hid himſelf: And ſo it will be with them, as ſoon as they hear the voice of God ſpeaking in the garden, in their hearts, ſaying, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> where art thou? Man, where art thou? Art thou worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping me in my Spirit, in my Truth, in my Jeſus that ſaves thee from ſin; and that not onely from the outward actions of ſin, but from the love and deſire to ſin? Man, where art thou? art thou in this Worſhip, or art thou in a Worſhip ſet up in thy own will to eſcape the puniſhment that is due to thee for thy ſins? and yet in thy heart thou love and delight in ſin as much as ever thou didſt. Man, where art thou? And when this day comes, as that it will certainly come, then their outward form of Worſhip, ſet up in their own wills for their own ends, to eſcape the apprehenſions of Gods Juſtice and Judgments to them for their ſins, will do them no more good than <hi>Adam</hi>'s Aprons of Fig-leaves covered his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and hid him from Gods Juſtice for his ſin; but they will be as open, and lie as naked to the manifeſtations of Gods Juſtice and Judgments to them for their ſins, as if they had never had any outward form of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>I having had experience how ſubtilly the Serpent works, twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and turning himſelf about in the heart of man (the garden of God in man) upon the Tree of knowledge, and when he ſees he cannot keep man from being in ſome outward form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and thereby be kept from running into outward ſins and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as once he had done, whereby the manifeſtations and making known of Gods Juſtice and Judgments ſeize ſo upon man for his ſins, as that man knew not how to bear it; then the Serpent wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly let man in his will to ſet upon an outward form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, thereby to take off the fierceneſs of the manifeſtation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known of Gods Juſtice and Judgments that he once lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for ſin. And the ſubtile Serpent cares not what outward form of Worſhip it is that man in his will, will ſet up to worſhip in, ſo that he can but keep alive in him the love to thoſe ſins that he outwardly leaves and forſakes: And becauſe he is afraid of Gods Juſtice for the committing of thoſe ſins, man may make the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152785:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> as clear as he will, as did the Phariſees, if the inſide be but foul, if the love do but ſtill remain to the ſins, or to any one ſin; the Serpent, rather than he will wholly loſe his Kingdom, he will content himſelf if he can but rule and raign in the inward love to ſin, although it be but to one dearly beloved ſin.</p>
               <p>I alſo knowing the readineſs and the proneneſs that is in man to yield to the ſubtilty of the Serpent, and for his own ends, for his own preſervation, to be kept from being killed or ſlain by the Juſtice of God, (as it was with <hi>Jeroboam</hi> when he ſet up his Calves, which he did for his own preſervation to be kept from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 27.) Man to be preſerved and kept from the Juſtice and Judgments of God for ſin, he ſets up and ſets upon an outward form of Worſhip, and ſuch an outward form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as that he thinks that God will be beſt pleaſed in: And in this Worſhip he ſets up his Altar of outward ſelf-obedience to God, and upon this Altar he offers his Sacrifice of an outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and that very ſtrictly too, of all and every of thoſe things that are outwardly required or deſired in that outward form of Worſhip that in his will he ſets or takes up. And in this his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of his Sacrifice of a ſtrict and devout obſerving and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all and every of thoſe things that are outwardly required and deſired in that outward form of Worſhip, which in his will he ſets up, and upon the Altar ſet up by him of his outward ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to God. In this man ſatisfies, pleaſes, and contents himſelf (as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did with his Calves) inſtead of the true Worſhip of God, which is to worſhip him in his Spirit, and in his Truth, in his Jeſus, in that which ſaves from ſin; and that not onely from the outward actions of ſin, for fear of the puniſhment: but this Worſhip of God that is done in Spirit, and in his Truth, in his Jeſus, in that which ſaves from ſin, there is in this Worſhip a knowing of a being ſaved from the love to ſin, as well as a being ſaved from the outward actions of ſin.</p>
               <p>I ſay, I knowing and having experienced how man thus by the ſubtilty of the Serpent, is ready to ſet up a Worſhip to himſelf (as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did) inſtead of the true Worſhip of God, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar ſet up by himſelf of ſelf-obedience to God, and there upon that Altar to offer his Sacrifices of a ſtrict and devout doing and performing of all and every the outward things that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or deſired in that outward form of Worſhip; and thereby and therein to pleaſe, ſatisfie, and content themſelves, as if they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152785:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> were worſhipping God in his Spirit, and in his Truth, in his Jeſus that does not onely ſave from the outward acts of ſin, but ſaves from the root of ſin, from the love to ſin.</p>
               <p>God cauſed me to cry out againſt this Altar of ſelf-obedience to God, and againſt the Sacrifices offered upon it, to pleaſe, ſatisfie, and content themſelves in a ſtrict obſerving, doing, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all and every the outward things required in the outward Worſhip that they did ſet up (as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, and neglected the true Worſhip of God) and neglected the Worſhip of God in his Spirit, and in his Truth, and in that which doth not onely ſave from ſin in the act, but from ſin in the love of it. And in telling them the danger that would follow and befal ſuch a Worſhip, as I had experienced, and if any of them had ſet up ſuch a Worſhip, not charging any particular perſon with ſo doing, but declaring what I knew of the ſubtilty of the Serpent putting man upon ſo doing, and the danger that they were in who were in ſuch a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And where is there a Meeting that there is no ſuch Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in? But that all and every perſon that belongs to the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are ſuch and onely ſuch as are worſhipping God in his Spirit, and in his Truth, in his Jeſus, that does not onely ſave them from the outward actions of ſin, but from the love and deſire to ſin. And thoſe that are not thus worſhpping God, in his Spirit, and in his Truth, in his Jeſus, in that which ſaves from ſin; and not onely ſaves from outward ſins taken notice of by men to be ſins, but ſaves from the root of ſin, from the love to ſin. Let them be what they will be, and think of themſelves as highly as they will, and be never ſo highly eſteemed of by others, yet I muſt once more tell them, whatſoever outward Worſhip it is that they profeſs, it is but a Worſhip that the ſubtile Serpent puts them upon; and they are with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> making of Calves, and ſaying in their hearts, theſe be the gods that have ſaved thee from that bondage and ſlavery that once they were under by and for their outward ſins; and all that they are doing in that Worſhip, is but an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Sacrifice upon that Altar that they have ſet up of ſelf-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſay, that upon my thus crying out againſt this Altar of ſelf obedience to God, and the Sacrifices offered thereon, that King <hi>Jeroboam</hi> put out his hand, and ſaid, <hi>Lay hold on him;</hi> but this I can ſay, that he that looked upon himſelf as the chief man in the Meeting, and was ſo eſteemed of by others, he often, when I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152785:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> was ſpeaking to the purpoſes aforeſaid, would riſe up and go out of the Meeting, and the reſt of the Meeting would follow him; I ſhall not ſay that he had done as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, make Calves for his own ſafety to preſerve his life, and was offering Sacrifice upon the Altar of Self-obedience, and therefore with <hi>Jeroboam</hi> could not indure to hear his Altar to be cry'd out againſt; but the Tree is known by its fruit.</p>
               <p>Some others although they followed his example of going out of the Meeting, yet they ſhew ſomething more of the following of Chriſts Command than he did, and they would come ſometimes and ſpeak to me about my ſpeaking, which I always gave them mild and very gentle anſwers, as I know none of them dare ſay to the contrary; and although they had nothing to ſay againſt what I ſpoke, but that my words were true; nor had they any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Life and Converſation, they could not deny but that I lived as blameleſs as any of them. But the great thing they had to ſay againſt my ſpeaking, was becauſe my words did not reach the witneſs of God in them, or the ſeed of God in them, as they called it; but when I ſpake, there was ſomething in them that was troubled and burdened, and therefore they put out their hands to lay hold on me, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſiring me to ſpeak no more: And by what ſpirit it was that they ſpake thus to me, I have here already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in declaring in what ſpirit it was that <hi>Peter</hi> rebuked Jeſus in, for ſpeaking what was true; and how Jeſus words were a trouble and a burden to a will that oppoſed Gods will in <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Twelve, and ſo ſhall ſay no more of it now.</p>
               <p>From this great diſturbance my ſpeaking to the aforeſaid purpoſes had made to that will in them, that could not endure to hear true words ſpoken in declaring and making known the ſubtilty of the Serpent, how he kept up his Kingdom in man, in and under an outward form of godlineſs of being like God, when he diſobeys God in that he does not worſhip him in his ſpirit, and in his truth, in his Jeſus, as he perſwaded man at firſt, and thereby cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to fall, telling him, by diſobeying God he <hi>ſhould be as Gods.</hi> This did ſo diſturb, burden, and trouble that will in them, that when there came any to the Meeting that day, that they were willing to hear them ſpeak words, that many times if I did while ſuch were there, when none was either ſpeaking or praying, yet if I began to ſpeak a few words, then one or other of them would
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152785:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> either ſtand up and fall a ſpeaking, or fall down upon their knees and pray, or elſe go out of the Meeting, and ſo break up the Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and ſo they put out their hands againſt me, ſaying, <hi>Lay hold on him:</hi> Yet amongſt all theſe that did put forth their hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, there was never any one of them that would begin a diſcourſe with me, concerning my ſpeaking, no not one of them; and yet I conſtantly when the Meeting was ended, followed them to the aforeſaid chief mans houſe whither they conſtantly went, and there ſtayed till they went from thence; if they went from thence that night, I ſaw their going away; and if they ſtayed there all night, then I ſtayed there until they were about going to ſupper: And ſometimes I would begin the diſcourſe with them, to know why they dealt ſo by me, but I received very pitiful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers from them, ſometimes they would ſay they thought I had done ſpeaking, becauſe I did not follow on to ſpeak ſo faſt as ſome do; and ſometimes I had this anſwer, that if any thing be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to another that ſitteth by, the firſt was to hold his peace; and therefore when they began to ſpeak, I was to hold my peace; indeed I did ſo, becauſe I would beget no diſturbance; but that is not the meaning of the Scripture, but the meaning of the Scripture is quite contrary, for if any thing be revealed to one that ſitteth by, the firſt is to hold his peace, before he that had any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him was to begin to ſpeak, or elſe how could they all Prophecy one by one, and it was the practice of the Apoſtles, as you may read <hi>Acts</hi> 15. And it is the conſtant practice amongſt them, that the one leaves ſpeaking before the other begins; but ſo much the ſubtilty of the Serpent had prevailed with them, as to excuſe themſelves for what they had done, as that they would wrong and abuſe the Scripture, and not onely the Scripture, but their own practice. Others of them wherein the ſubtilty of the Serpent did not ſo much appear in ſewing fig-leaves together to make themſelves Aprons to cover their nakedneſs with: They dealt plainly with me, and told me, that indeed they had nothing againſt the words I ſpake, nor againſt me, but the reaſon why they did it was, becauſe they were informed that my ſpeaking at other times was a burden and trouble to many in the Meeting. Theſe are truly in ſubſtance the very Anſwers that have been given me, when I have begun any diſcourſe with any of them, to know why they dealt ſo diſorderly by me: And I ſhall leave it to the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in every mans Conſcience, whether theſe in their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152785:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> thus dealing with me, were not in the ſame ſtate and condition, and carryed out by the ſame ſpirit that the Twelve were in, when they met with one caſting out Devils in Jeſus Name, and they forbade him, becauſe he did not follow them.</p>
               <p>When Jeſus had caſt out of the <hi>Gaderean</hi> the unclean ſpirits or devils, he commanded him to go home to his houſe, to his friends, and tell them and ſhew unto them how great things the Lord had done for him, and had compaſſion on him; and he obeyed the Command of Jeſus, in publiſhing throughout the whole City how great things Jeſus had done for him, and all men did marvel, as you may ſee <hi>Mark 5.

               <p>I ſhall leave it to the witneſs of God in every one, to judge whether or no theſe <hi>Gaderenes</hi> ſhall not riſe up in Judgment and condemn ſome, that when Jeſus had caſt out the uoclean ſpirits or devils out of a man, and commanded him to tell, to ſhew what great things that God had done for him, to his friends where he lived that when he began to tell and to ſhew what great things that God had done for him, they would not ſtay to hear him, but

               <p>But all this did not in the leaſt diſturb, diſquiet, or trouble me, although I was looked upon by moſt of them, as <hi>Ahab</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Elijah</hi> to be a Troubler of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for when I went after the Meetings were ended to the aforeſaid chief mans houſe, not one in five of them would take any notice of me, not ſo much as to give me the hand, the uſual cuſtom amongſt them, at their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that ſo if I had wanted a hand to have been helped to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereby, I muſt have ſtayed behind for any help I ſhould have had of them: And if they were going by me at their going away out of the houſe, they would turn their backs to me, and their faces another way, becauſe they would not ſee me; and yet all this never in the leaſt moved me, but I was kept by the ſpirit of Jeſus in me in quietneſs and peace in me, knowing whoſe work it was that I did; although by their dealings with me, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood I was not onely ſleighted by them, but made an hiſs and by-word among thoſe called of the World; for what they did by me, was not done in a corner, but openly, publickly, ſometimes in the preſence of ſome hundreds that came to the Meeting out of ſeveral Pariſhes round about; and the great man of the Meeting, when one time I was at a monthly Meeting, and there made a complaint of the Meeting, that they did not deal by me, as I had in a Book of theirs kept for the County at the place of the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting, read, That it was an order made in general for all Meetings, that they ſhould do for me or any other; and it was owned by the monthly Meeting, that they ought to deal by me as I had deſired of them, and as it was writ in their Book they ought to do it; yet this great man of eſteem ſtood it out againſt the Meeting, that it ſhould not be done for me, although it was owned by the Meeting in general to be my right; and to excuſe himſelf why it ſhould not be done for me, he openly fell upon me in words, ſaying, That I was the greateſt trouble and burden to the Meeting, that ever the Meeting met withal; and why was it, but for the words I ſpake in the Meeting? he could not deny but that my life and Converſation was as blameleſs as his or any that did belong to their Meeting, and ſo I was owned to live by the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152785:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> monthly Meeting, and I refer my ſelf to thoſe that were at the monthly Meeting, how patiently I did bear it, and how little I ſpake in my own defence, although I had truth on my ſide, as in general the monthly Meeting owned (and although as to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things they knew I was not any thing beneath any of them.) All this their dealings by me did not in the leaſt abate or hinder me for crying out againſt the Altar of Self-obedience, and againſt the Offerings offered thereupon, in a very ſtrict and devout obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, doing, and performing all and every the outward things that is deſired and required in that outward form of Worſhip in their Wills ſet by them, and thereby and therein to pleaſe, ſatisfie, and content themſelves, as if they were worſhipping God in his ſpirit and in his truth, in his Jeſus that ſaves from ſin, and alſo telling of them what would follow and fall upon them for ſuch Worſhip and Service.</p>
               <p>But at length it happened to me, as it did to the man of God ſent to cry againſt the Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> who King <hi>Jeroboam</hi> by his threatning nor by his friendſhip could prevail with to diſobey any part of the Command of God; but he was prevailed with and brought into diſobedience by an old Prophet, that told him that an Angel ſpake to him by the Word of the Lord; but he lyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he had no Angel ſpake to him, nor no Word from the Lord to ſay what he did to the man ſent of God: It was the old lying Serpents ſelf in him that ſpake theſe words to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he deceived the man ſent of God; and ſo it happened to me. All the bad dealings that I had received did not in the leaſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me in my obedience to any part of the Command of God, in ſpeaking what I had in Command to ſpeak; but it ſo happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I was in Company with three Women called Old Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, of great eſteem amongſt them, and although in plain words they did not give themſelves the Name of Propheteſs, as the old Prophet did, or ſay as he did, that an Angel ſpake to him by the word of the Lord, yet they ſpake words to the ſame purpoſe, That they were moved by the ſpirit of God to ſpeak to me, and that it was in the Name of God, and for Gods ſake, and many words to theſe purpoſes that they uſed to me; and that although as they ſaid they did not know one anothers minds, nor had ſaid nothing of it before, yet they did ſpeak to that purpoſe, as if they all of them ſeverally one by another had a Command from God, and that they were all moved by the ſpirit of God in them,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152785:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> at that time to ſpeak to me, and let me know from God, that what I ſpake in the Meeting, I did not ſpeak by a true moving of the ſpirit of God in me, but it was the wrong ſpirits ſelf in me, that put me forward to ſpeak; and very many words they ſpake to me to theſe purpoſes: And I having had a large experience of the ſubtilty of the Serpents ſelf in me, and how he had in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times deceived me in a ſhew of godlineſs, and then they all as the old Prophet did, did affirm that they had a ſeveral Angel, or as they called it, a ſeveral moving of the ſpirit of God, ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did move in each of them, and put them upon it to ſpeak to me by the word of the Lord in them (although I now know they all lyed to me, as the old Prophet did) yet theſe their lying words then ſpoken in the Name of the Lord, deceived me, as the lying words of the old Prophet deceived the man ſent of God, and they cauſed me as the Serpent did <hi>Eve,</hi> who at firſt reſiſted the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but afterwards ſhe yielded to queſtion or doubt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, whether God had ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the Garden;</hi> and ſo at firſt I reſiſted them very ſtrongly, yet at length through their many words, I queſtion'd or doubted whether God had commanded me to ſpeak as I had ſpoken, although I did before know that God had Commanded me to ſpeak, as <hi>Eve</hi> knew that God had ſaid they ſhould <hi>not eat of every tree of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> there was one Tree that God had Commanded that they ſhould not eat thereof: And in this knowledge of what was Gods Command, <hi>Eve</hi> had obeyed God in, as I in that knowledge that it was the Command of God for me to ſpeak, had obeyed God in; but it was with me as it was with <hi>Eve,</hi> and the man ſent of God (who at firſt reſiſted and ſaid Nay to the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) after the Serpent by his deceit and lye, had cauſed <hi>Eve</hi> to queſtion or doubt, whether God had Commanded what ſhe in her ſelf before knew to be the Command of God, and from that knowledge that ſhe had in her ſelf that it was the Command of God, ſhe had yielded obedience unto it; but ſoon after the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent had wrought in her to queſtion or doubt, whether it was the Command of God or no, he ſoon by his lying brought her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey God in his Command, and it coſt her her life; and ſo the man ſent of God, he knew that it was the Command of God in him, that he ſhould not eat bread or drink water in that place, and he for a time obeyed the Command of God in him, and did not yield to the deſire of the old Prophet; but when by the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152785:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the old Prophet, and that in the word of the Lord, as the old Serpent in him cauſed him to ſay, he queſtioned the truth of the Command of God in him, which before he had obeyed, and would not for the fear or friendſhip of a King be prevailed with into the diſobedience of any part of it; yet by the lye of one that called himſelf a Prophet, and ſent of God as he was, he went from obeying what he had known to be the true Command of God in him, and believed the lye that the lying old Prophet had told him was the Command of God for him to obey God in, and that coſt him his life; and ſo it was with me, although at firſt I reſiſted them ſtrongly, and would give no way to them, yet afterwards by the lyes that they told me in the word of the Lord, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to me, that it was by the motion of the ſpirit of God in them, that they ſpake to me, I giving ſome credit to them, as <hi>Eve</hi> did to the Serpent, and the man ſent of God to the old lying Prophet, I began to queſtion the truth of the Command of God in me, which before I knew to be the Command of God in me, and had obeyed God therein; and I did with <hi>Eve</hi> and the man of God, who gave more credit to the lye the Serpent told, and the old Prophet told, than to the truth ſpoken in them and to them by the ſpirit of God; and ſo did I give more credit to the lye that they ſpake to me, in that they told me it was by the moving of ſelf in me that I ſpake, and not by the Command of God; and by believing them in their lye, I went out of the obedience to what I knew was the Command of God in me, and to me, and for a time I had obeyed God in, which all the hard or bad dealings that I had met withal could not in the leaſt prevail with me, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Command of God in me and to me, to ſpeak what God had given me in Command to ſpeak; but I was prevailed with, and prevailed over by the lyes ſpoken in the Name of the Lord (as was pretended) by the three old Quakers (ſo called) and no ſooner did I by the lyes that they had ſpoken to me, begin to queſtion or doubt of the truth of Gods Command in me to ſpeak, but there quietly got up in me a diſobedience to the Command; and when I found in me a motion to ſpeak as formerly I had, I did not yield obedience to the motion, but went into the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and kept ſilence, as they had deſired of me to do, and ſo it coſt me my life, for ſoon after <hi>a Lion by the way met with me and ſlew me.</hi>

               <p>Jeſus, as he is the Lamb of God in making known in man and to man the Commands of God, what man is to do in obedience to God; and ſo in mans yielding of obedience to the Commands of God, he makes known the love of God to man and in man, and thus as a Lamb, and act in man like a Lamb in innocency, ſo he may be ſlain, yea, he is ſlain in man by his diſobedience to God. As I have known the ſlaying of him, by my diſobedience to the Command of God, and as he is thus a Lamb in man, and acts the part of a Lamb in man, ſo the ſame God, the ſame Power, that hath ſent him as a Jeſus to ſave man, to ſave all men that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, that will yield obedience to what he makes known in them and to them, to be the Command of God for them to obey God in; ſo the ſame God, the ſame Power hath made him Judge both of the Living and of the Dead: And ſo as he is a Judge, he is the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and that as a Lion, as a Judge I found him, ſoon meeting of me after my diſobedience, in not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the Command of God, to ſpeak as he gave me a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to ſpeak, and he ſlew me, he paſſed the ſentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon me for my diſobedience, and made me ſenſible of my diſobedience, and I knew I had tranſgreſſed, and I willingly ſubmitted to Gods Chaſtiſement, as did the man ſent from God, when it was told him, that for his diſobedience that his Carkaſs ſhould not come to the Sepulchre of his Fathers: You do not read in the Scripture that in the leaſt he murmured or reflected upon the Chaſtiſement of God for his diſobedience.</p>
               <p>And the paſſing of this ſentence of Condemnation upon me was ſo great, as that I may truly ſay it ſlew me; that is, as to my own apprehenſions I was as it were ſlain, in that I did not find any more movings of God in me to ſpeak, as I formerly had, nor did I find in me any more ſtirrings or drawings of the ſpirit of God in me, to Meditation, Contemplation, or muſing of God, and of his Goodneſs to me, as before my diſobedience I often had and was much refreſhed and comforted thereby, in what God in thoſe Meditations, Contemplations, or muſings of God, and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made known to me of himſelf, in what he was to man as a Creator and a Redeemer, and what man was in his Image and likeneſs, as Created and Redeemed; nor did I find ſuch freſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations and making known of Gods love to me, as before I had done, thereby to cauſe my love to increaſe to God; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I went to the Meeting, and kept it conſtantly as before,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152785:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> yet I found no comfort or refreſhment thereby, as formerly I had done when I ſtood in my obedience to God.</p>
               <p>And in this ſlain ſtate for my diſobedience, I continued a long time. At length, the firſt appearance that I apprehended or took notice of that God ſtirred or moved in me by his Spirit, was the movings or ſtirrings up of a deſire in me to underſtand the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Woman, the Garden, the Serpent, the forbidden Fruit, and the eating of it, and the death that man died in the day he eat thereof: And to leave ſomething of it in writing (not in print, I had no thoughts of any ſuch thing then) that others might know what God had made known to me of the ſubtilty of the Serpent in man; and ſo little did I then think of writing much, that I began upon half a ſheet of Paper, thinking upon that I might write what was Gods will that I ſhould leave in writing; but it exceeded the half ſheet, and came into ſeveral ſheets: And when I thought I had done writing, and had tacked the ſheets to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, intending to ſend them to printing, it pleaſed God to take from me a Child, whom I loved, as being in the outward body more like me than any Child I had; and ſuch was Gods goodneſs to me, although I had a natural affection to her as a Father, yet I was ſo well ſatisfied with the will of God therein, that it was no inward trouble or diſturbance to me, but I was as if it had not been, in having my will reſigned and given up into the will of God therein. And then God moved and ſtirred in me to write ſomething of what I knew of denying my ſelf, and taking up the Croſs and following of Jeſus; and I did not think therein to have writ ſo much as would have filled one ſheet of Paper; not having the leaſt thought, as God is my witneſs, of making any the leaſt mention of what I knew of taking up the Croſs and following of Jeſus, when I ſtood in my obedience to him, in ſpeaking what he had given me in command to ſpeak through all the oppoſing I met with; but finding it lay as a duty upon me, after I had began to write of ſelf-denial, and taking up the Croſs and following of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, I was then and thereby, as my duty required to make known what I knew, how the ſubtile Serpent deceives man in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of Religion, perſwading them that in that outward form of Religion, they are denying of themſelves, and taking up the Croſs and following of Jeſus; when indeed and in truth they are but a ſetting up of ſelf in them: And I have yielded in doing my duty therein, leſt through my diſobedience therein, God might
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152785:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> have dealt with me as he did by me for my diſobedience in not ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>And if any that ſhall read what I have herein writ, and there ſhall and does riſe in them a ſpirit to think or to ſpeak that I have not done well in it, to make ſo publick the failings, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, infirmities, or miſcarriages of Friends to me, or rather to that of Jeſus in me; I ſhall ſay, that by the ſame Spirit they may upon the ſame grounds as well think and ſay that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> did not do well, or rather the ſpirit of God in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> did not do well in making, by writing ſo much, more publick the failings, weakneſs, infirmities, or miſcarriages of the Twelve to Jeſus; as I have done the failings, weakneſs, infirmities, or miſcarriages of others to that which was of Jeſus in me. But ſo it hath pleaſed the infinite wiſe God to leave their failings, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, infirmities, or miſcarriages, and not onely theirs, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his faithful Servants, in writing, and now in print; not to the end to be as Examples for us to follow, but to be as Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for us to have a care that we by the ſubtilty of the Serpent, do not fall as they did: for they and we ſtand and are ſaved by all one and the ſame Faith, in the ſame Jeſus; and what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is written for our Inſtruction and Learning.</p>
               <p>And I know that the ſame Spirit that will blame me for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo publick the dealings of Friends by me, will alſo blame me for medling with the failings, weakneſſes, infirmities, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of the Twelve; as it did in ſome Friends for ſpeaking of the failings of <hi>Job,</hi> who although perfect and upright, and how patiently he bore what God ſuffered Satan to afflict him with, yet his patience did not always continue the ſame; for if it had, he would never have curſed the day of his birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I made but uſe of this in my ſpeaking in the Meeting, to ſhew what great need we all had to ſtand upon our watch, leſt at any time we be overcome by the ſubtilty of the Adverſary; and this gave ſuch an offence, that I was by two, counted no ſmall Friends, at two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, rebuked for mentioning <hi>Job</hi>'s failings.</p>
               <p>And therefore I expect no other, but by the ſame Spirit I ſhall be ſentenced and judged for my making ſo publick the dealings of thoſe called Friends or Quakers to me, or rather to that which was of Jeſus in me; but if they do, I know by what Spirit it is that they ſo judge and cenſure me: That it is not by the ſpirit of God, for the example of the ſpirit of God I follow; it is the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152785:99" rendition="simple:additions"/> example of God by his ſpirit in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in writing the dealings of the Twelve by Jeſus: It is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God by his ſpirit in <hi>Paul,</hi> to make publick in writing <hi>Peter</hi>'s not walking uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel, but diſſembled: It is the example of God by his ſpirit in the holy men of old, that gave forth the Scriptures, to make publick in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the failings of the beſt of his Servants; as of <hi>Noah, Abraham, Lot, Moſes, David, Job,</hi> and others: And therefore I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the words of Jeſus, <hi>Mat. 10. 24, 25. The diſciple is not above his maſter, nor the ſervant above his lord. It is enough for the diſciple that he is as his maſter, and the ſervant as his lord: if they have called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub, how much more ſhall they call them of the houſhold?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have forborn the mentioning of any Name or Names, and ſo I ſhall, unleſs I hear what I have written be contradicted, or the truth of it queſtioned; and then I may not onely name the Names of the Perſons, but the Places where they either ſpake, or did what I have herein mentioned.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152785:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> him, and that by them, that he had ſaid ſhould be done to him, and that by them; as when he told them they ſhould be all offended becauſe of him that night, and ſo offended as to be ſcattered and forſake him; and as he ſaid they ſhould therein deal by him, ſo they did deal by him, although they had all ſaid they would not deal ſo by him. And moreover, there was one of the Twelve that for the love he had to money, betrayed him and ſold him to them that he knew ſought for him to take away his life. Thus much you may read in the Scriptures, of the dealings of the Twelve by Jeſus: And therefore I do ſay, that the ſame evil Spirit that would have thee to judge or think the worſe of the Truth that is owned and believed by thoſe called Quakers, of their worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God in Spirit and Truth, becauſe of what I have writ, that ſome of them have done to me. The ſame evil Spirit, upon the ſame ground, may cauſe thee to judge and think the worſe of Jeſus, and of the truth that Jeſus preached, becauſe of what the Twelve did to him, that thou mayeſt read written in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>God knows and bears me witneſs, that why I make mention of their dealings to me, is to do what I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved I ought to do; thereby to make known what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and acquaintance man may have of Jeſus in the fleſh, and yet not know Jeſus in his Death and Reſurrection, as the Twelve who had the moſt knowledge of him and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him in the fleſh, and were ſent by him to preach and caſt out Devils, and yet knew him not in his Death and Reſurrection. And therefore man may go a great way in an outward form of Worſhip, and in an outward following of Jeſus, and yet not come fully to know what it is to deny himſelf daily, and take up his Croſs to all ſelf, and be a Follower of Jeſus in the Spirit. As the Twelve, although they followed him in the fleſh, and ſo had the moſt acquaintance with him, yet they had
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152785:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> not in that time of their knowing of him and following of him in the fleſh, ſo fully learned that Leſſon of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial and taking up of the daily Croſs to their own wills, as they learned it when they knew his Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in themſelves, and followed him in the Spirit: And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>They knew no man after the fleſh: yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we him no more.</hi>
